But O 
the O
performance O
of O
Mac O
Mini O
is O
a O
huge O
disappointment O	

They O
don't O
just O
look O
good O
; O
they O 
deliver O 
excellent O
performance O	

I B-OH
have O
had O
it O
over O
a O
year O
now O
with O
out O
a O
Glitch O
of O
any O
kind.O
. O
I B-OH
love O
the O
lit O
up O 
keys O
and O
screen O
display O
... O
this O
thing O
is O
Fast O
and O
clear O
as O
can O
be O	

The O
Mountain O
Lion O
OS O
is O
not O
hard O
to O
figure O
O O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O 
Microsoft O
Windows O	

However O
, O
I B-OH
can O
refute O
that O
OSX O
is O
`` O
FAST O
 '' O	

Enjoy O
using O
Microsoft O
Office O	

Incredible O
graphics O
and O
brilliant O
colors O	

Built-in O
apps O
are O
purely O
amazing O	

From O
the O
speed O
to O
the O
multi O 
touch O
gestures O
this O
operating O
system O
beats O
Windows O
easily O	

I B-OH
really O
like O
the O
size O
and O
I B-OH
'm O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
ACERS	O

I B-OH
opted O
for O
the O

( O

which O
also O
support O
``accidents O
'' O
like O
drops O
and O
spills O
that O
are O
NOT O
covered O
by O
AppleCare O	

It's O
light O
and O
easy O
to O
transport O	

Once O
you O
get O
past O
learning O
how O
to O
use O
the O
poorly O
designed O
Windows O
8 O
Set-Up O
you O
may O
feel O
frustrated O 

The O
aluminum O
body O
sure O
makes O
it O
stand O
O O	

It O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
integrate O
bluetooth O
devices O
, O
and O
USB O
devices O
are O
recognized O
almost O
instantly O	

And O
the O
fact O
that O
Apple O
is O
driving O
the O
13 O
'' O
RMBP O
with O
the O
Intel4000 O
graphic O

underpowered O
to O
me B-OH	 

Apple O
removed O
the O
DVD O
drive O 
Firewire O
port O
( O
will O
work O
with O

and O
put O
the O

slot O
in O
a O
silly O
position O
on O
the O
back O	

The O
durability O
of O
the O
laptop O
will O
make O
it O
worth O
the O
money	O 

Well O
designed O
and O
fast O	

But O
I B-OH
was O
completely O
wrong O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
UNBELIEVABLE O
amazing O
and O
easy O
to O
use O	

Exactly O
as O
posted O
plus O
a O
great O
value	O

The O

else O
can O
i B-OH
ask O

This O

terrific O	

It O

really O
thick O
around O
the O

And O

Great O

, O
great O

, O
great O

great O

: O
] O
It O
arrived O
so O
fast O
and O
customer O
service O
was O
great	O 

tried O
windows O
8 O
and O
hated O
it O	

Set O
up O
was O
a O
breeze O	

But O
I B-OH
do O
NOT O
like O
Win8 O

I B-OH
had O
the O
same O
reasons O
as O
most O
PC O
users O
: O
the O
price O
, O
the O
overbearing O
restrictions O
of O
OSX O
and O
lack O
of O
support O
for O
games	O

I B-OH
wanted O
it O
for O
it's O
mobility O
and O
man O
, O
this O
little O
bad O
boy O
is O
very O
nice O

I B-OH
found O
the O
mini O
to O
be O
: O
Exceptionally O
easy O
to O
set O
up O	

The O
sound O
is O
nice O
and O
loud O
; O
I B-OH
don't O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
hearing O
anything O	

It O
is O
very O
slim O
, O
the O
track O
pad O
is O
very O
much O
impressed O
with O
me B-OH	

The O
settings O
are O
not O
user-friendly O
either O	

Thank O
goodness O
for O
OpenOffice O	

Awesome O
form O
factor O
, O
great O
battery O
life O
, O
wonderful O
UX O	

i B-OH
love O
the O
keyboard O
and O
the O
screen O	

However O
, O
there O
are O
MAJOR O
issues O
with O
the O
touchpad O
which O
render O
the O
device O
nearly O
useless O	

I've O
already O
upgraded O
o O
Mavericks O
and O
I B-OH
am O
impressed O
with O
everything O
abO O
this O
computer O	

Not O
as O
fast O
as O
I B-OH
would O
have O
expect O
for O
an O
i5 O	

thanks O
for O
great O
service O
and O
shipping O	

The O
performance O
seems O
quite O
good O
, O
and O
built-in O
applications O
like O
iPhoto O
work O
great O
with O
my B-OH
phone O
and O
camera O	

I B-OH
did O
swap O
O O
the O
hard O
drive O
for O
a O
Samsung O
830 O
SSD O
which O
I B-OH
highly O
recommend O	

Yes O
, O
that's O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
but O
it's O
made O
from O
aluminum O
that O
scratches O
easily O	

I B-OH
was O
also O
informed O
that O
the O
components O
of O
the O
Mac O
Book O
were O
dirty	O

the O
hardware O
problems O
have O
been O
so O
bad O
, 
i O
can't O
wait O
till O
it O
completely O
dies O
in O
3 O
years O
, O
TOPS O

It's O
so O
nice O
that O
the O
battery O
last O
so O
long O
and O
that O
this O
machine O
has O
the O
snow O
lion O

it's O
exactly O
what O
i B-OH
wanted O
, O
and O
it O
has O
all O
the O
new O
features O
and O
whatnot O	

It O
feels O
cheap O
, O
the O
keyboard O
is O
not O
very O
sensitive O	

Though O
please O
note O
that O
sometimes O
it O
crashes O
, O
and O
the O
sound O
quality O
isnt O
superb O	

It O
is O
very O
easy O 
to O
navigate O
even O
for O
a O
novice O	

Does O
everything O
I B-OH
need O
it O
to O
, O
has O
a O
wonderful O
battery O
life O
and O
I B-OH
couldn't O
be O
happier O	

Great O
Performance O
and O
Quality O

One O
more O
thing O
, O
this O
mac O
does O
NOT O
come O
with O
restore O
disks O
and O
I B-OH
am O
not O
sure O
if O
you O
can O
make O
them O
direct O
from O
the O
mac O
like O
you O
can O
with O
newer O
PC's O
, O
also O
the O
charging O 
cables O
are O
made O
of O
the O
same O
cheap O
material O
as O
the O
iPhone/iPod O
touch O
cables O	

The O
new O
os O
is O
great O
on O
my B-OH
macbook O
pro O

I B-OH
have O
experienced O
no O
problems O
, O
works O 
as O
anticipated	O 

System O
is O
running O
great O 

Easy O
to O
customize O
setting O
and O
even O
create O
your O
own O
bookmarks O	

it O
has O
all O
the O
features O
that O
we O
expected O
and O
the O
price O
was O
good O
, O
working O
well O
so O
far O	

The O
new O
operating O
system O
makes O
this O
computer O
into O
a O
super O
iPad O

Easy O
to O
set O
up O
and O
go O	

I B-OH
can't O
believe O
how O
quiet O
the O
hard O
drive O
is O
and O
how O
quick O
this O
thing O
boots O
up O	

It's O
just O
what O
we B-OH
were O
looking O
for O
and O
it O
works O
great	O

It's O
so O
quick O
and O
responsive O
that O
it O
makes O
working O
/ O
surfing O
on O
a O
computer O
so O
much O
more O
pleasurable	O 

It O
works O
fine O
, O
and O
all O
the O
software O
seems O
to O
run O
pretty O
well O

I B-OH
wanted O
a O
computer O
that O
was O
quite O
, O
fast O
, O
and O
that O
had O
overall O
great O
performance O

Harddrive O
was O
in O
poor O
condition O
, O
had O
to O
replace O
it O

The O
on/off O
switch O
is O
a O
bit O
obscure O
in O
the O
rear O
corner O	

My B-OH
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
instructions O
that O
come O
with O
the O
mac O
mini O

The O
only O
task O
that O
this O
computer O
would O
not O
be O
good O
enough O
for O
would O
be O
gaming O
, O
otherwise O
the O
integrated O
Intel O
4000 O
graphics O
work O
well O
for O
other O
tasks	O

I B-OH
use O
it O
mostly O
for O
content O
creation O
( O
Audio O
, O
video O
, O
photo O
editing O
) O
and O
its O
reliable O	

Screen O
is O
bright O
and O
gorgeous O	

It O
is O
robust O
, O
with O
a O
friendly O
use O
as O
all O
Apple O
products O	

It O
is O
fast O
and O
easy O
to O
use O	 

And O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
an O
i5 O
processor O
definitely O
speeds O
things O
up.O	

I B-OH
have O
been O
PC O
for O
years O
but O
this O
computer O
is O
intuitive O
and O
its O
built O
in O
features O
are O
a O
great O
help O 

Nice O
screen O
, O
keyboard O
works O
great	O  

I B-OH
was O
amazed O
at O
how O
fast O
the O
delivery O
was O

The O
memory O
was O
gone O
and O
it O
was O
not O
able O
to O
be O
used O 

It O
works O
great O
and O
I B-OH
am O
so O
happy O
I B-OH
bought O
it O	

I B-OH
like O
the O
design O
and O
ease O
of O
use O
with O
the O
keyboardO
, O
plenty O
of O
ports	O

it O
definitely O
beats O
my B-OH
old O
mac O
and O
the O
service O
was O
great	O

Web O
browsing O
is O
very O
quick O
with O
Safari O
browser O	

I B-OH
like O
the O
lighted O
screen O
at O
night O

It O
is O
really O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
it O
is O
quick O
to O
start O
up O	

I've O
lived O
with O
the O
crashes O
and O
slow O
operation O
and O
restarts O	 

USB3 O
Peripherals O
are O
noticably O
less O
expensive O
than O
the O
ThunderBolt O
ones O

It's O
fast O
, O
light O
, O
and O
is O
perfect O
for O
media O
editing O
, O
which O
is O
mostly O
why O
I B-OH
bought O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place	O 

The O
battery O
lasts O
as O
advertised O
( O
give O
or O
take O
15-20 O
minutes O
) O
, O
and O
the O
entire O
user O
experience O 
is O
very O
elegant O	

Thanks O
for O
the O
fast O
shipment O
and O
great O
price	O 

! O
Excellent O
performance O
, O
usability O
, O
presentation O
and O
time O
response O	

The O
smaller O
size O
was O
a O
bonus O
because O
of O
space O
restrictions O	

I B-OH
blame O
the O
Mac O
OS O

I B-OH
like O
the O
operating O
system O	

I B-OH
love O
the O
form O
factor O	

It's O
fast O
at O
loading O
the O
internet O	

So O
much O
faster O
and O
sleeker O
looking O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
runs O
XP O
and O
Microsoft O
is O
dropping O
support O
next O
April	O 

First O
off O
, O
I B-OH
really O
do O
like O
my B-OH
MBP O
... O
once O
used O
to O
the O
OS O
it O
is O
pretty O
easy O
to O
get O
around O
, O
and O
the O
overall O
build O
is O
great O
... O
eg O
the O
keyboard O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
to O
type O
on O

It O
is O
made O
of O
such O
solid O
construction O
and O
since O
I B-OH
have O
never O
had O
a O
Mac O
using O
my B-OH
iPhone O
helped O
me B-OH
get O
used O
to O
the O
system O
a O
bit O

Very O
nice O
unibody O
construction O	

This O
Macbook O
Pro O
is O
fast O
, O
powerful O
, O
and O
runs O
super O
quiet O
and O
cool O

It's O
ok O
but O
doesn't O
have O
a O
disk O
drive O
which O
I B-OH
didn't O
know O
until O
after O
I B-OH
bought O
it O

There O
is O
no O
HDMI O
receptacle O
, O
nor O
is O
there O
an O
SD O
card O
slot O
located O
anywhere O
on O
the O
device O

It O
came O
in O
brand O
new O
and O
works O
perfectly O

It O
shouldn't O
happen O
like O
that O
, O
I B-OH
don't O
have O
any O
design O
app O
open O
or O
anything O	

MY B-OH
TRACKPAD O
IS O
NOT O
WORKING O	

It O
looks O
and O
feels O
solid O
, O
with O
a O
flawless O
finish O	

Price O
was O
higher O
when O
purchased O
on O
MAC O
when O
compared O
to O
price O
showing O
on O
PC O
when O
I B-OH
bought O
this O
product O	

Then O
the O
system O
would O
many O
times O
not O
power O
down O
withO O
a O
forced O
power-off O

The O
configuration O
is O
perfect O
for O
my B-OH
needs	O 

and O
the O
speakers O
is O
the O
worst O
ever O	

Its O
the O
best O
, O
its O
got O
the O
looks O
, O
super O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
love O
all O
you O
can O
do O
with O
the O
trackpad O	

Web O
surfuring O
is O
smooth O
and O
seamless O	

I B-OH
'm O
overall O
pleased O
with O
the O
interface O

It O
was O
also O
suffering O
from O
hardware O
( O
keyboard O
 ) O
issues O
, O
relatively O
slow O
performance O
and O
shortening O
battery O
lifetime O 

Runs O

the O
job O
, O

complain O
abO O
that O

It's O
silent O
and O

a O
very O
small O
footprint O
on O
my B-OH
desk O

The O

gorgeous O

a O
very O
high O
performance O
, O
just O
for O
what O
I B-OH
needed O
for O

Apple O
is O
aware O
of O
this O
issue O
and O
this O
is O
either O
old O
stock O
or O
a O
defective O
design O
involving O
the O
intel O
4000 O
graphics O
chipset O

I B-OH
just O
bought O
the O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
the O
13'' O
model O
, O
and O
I B-OH
can't O
believe O
Apple O
keeps O
making O
the O
same O
mistake O
with O
regard O
to O
USB O
ports O

It O
is O
the O
perfect O
size O
and O
speed O
for O

THE O
CUSTOMER O
SERVICE O
IS O
TERRIFIC O 

My B-OH
last O
laptop O
was O
a O
17'' O
ASUS O
gaming O
machine O
, O
which O
performed O
admirably O
, O
but O
having O
since O
built O
my B-OH
own O
desktop O
and O
really O
settling O
into O
the O
college O
life O
, O
I B-OH
found O
myself O
wanting O
something O
smaller O
and O
less O
cumbersome O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
ASUS O
had O
been O
slowly O
developing O
problems O
ever O
since O
I B-OH
bought O
it O
abO O
4 O
years O
ago O

However O
, O
it O
did O
not O
have O
any O
scratches O
, O
ZERO O
battery O
cycle O
count O
( O
pretty O
surprised O
) O
, O
and O
all O
the O
hardware O
seemed O
to O
be O
working O
perfectly O

And O
as O
for O
all O
the O
fancy O
finger O
swipes O
-- O
I B-OH
just O
gave O
up O
and O
attached O
a O
mouse	O 

I B-OH
needed O
a O
laptop O
with O
big O
storage O
, O
a O
nice O
screen O
and O
fast O
so O
I B-OH
can O
photoshop O
withO O
any O
problem O

I B-OH
like O
coming O
back O
to O
Mac O
OS O
but O
this O
laptop O
is O
lacking O
in O
speaker O
quality O
compared O
to O
my B-OH
$ O
400 O
old O
HP O
laptop O

Shipped O
very O
quickly O
and O
safely O	

The O
thunderbolt O
port O
is O
awesome O	

The O
performance O
is O
definitely O
superior O
to O
any O
computer O
I B-OH
've O
ever O
put O
my B-OH
hands O
on O

It's O
great O
for O
streaming O
video O
and O
other O
entertainment O
uses O

I B-OH
like O
the O
design O
and O
its O
features O
but O
there O
are O
somethings O
I B-OH
think O
needs O
to O
be O
improved O 

There O
were O
small O
problems O
with O
Mac O
office O	

I B-OH
ordered O
my B-OH
2012 O
mac O
mini O
after O
being O
disappointed O
with O
spec O
of O
the O
