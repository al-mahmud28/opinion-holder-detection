I B-OH
charge O
it O
at O
night O
and O
skip O
taking O
the O
cord O
with O
me O
because O
of O
the O
good O
battery O
life O

it O
is O
of O
high O
quality O
, O
has O
a O
killer O 
GUI O
, O
is O
extremely O 
stable O
, O
is O
highly O 
expandable O 
, O
is O
bundled O 
with O
lots O
of O
very O
good O
applications O 
, O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
and O
is O
absolutely O
gorgeous O 

Easy O
to O
start O
up O
and O
does O
not O
overheat O 
as O
much O
as O
other O
laptops O	

Great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features O	

One O
night O
I B-OH
turned O
the O
freaking O 
thing O
off O
after O
using O
it O
, O
the O
next O
day O
I B-OH
turn O
it O
on O
, O
no O
GUI O
, O
screen O 
all O
dark O
, O
power O
light O
steady O
, O
hard O
drive O
light O
steady O
and O
not O
flashing O 
as O
it O
usually O 
does O 

However O
, O
the O
multi-touch O 
gestures O
and O
large O
tracking O
area O
make O
having O
an O
external O 
mouse O
unnecessary O 
( O
unless O 
you O
're O
gaming O
) O	

I B-OH
love O
the O
way O
the O
entire O
suite O
of O
software O 
works O
together O	 

The O
speed O
is O
incredible O 
and O
I B-OH
am O
more O
than O
satisfied O	 

I B-OH
can O 
barely O
use O
any O
usb O
devices O 
because O
they O
will O
not O
stay O
connected O 
properly O

When O
I B-OH
finally O
had O
everything O 
running O
with O
all O
my O
software O 
installed O
I B-OH
plugged O
in O
my O
droid O
to O
recharge O 
and O
the O
system O
crashed O

Pairing O
it O
with O
an O
iPhone O 
is O
a O
pure O
pleasure O 
- O
talk O
abO O
painless O
syncing O
- O
used O
to O
take O
me O
forever O 
- O
now O
it's O
a O
snap O	

I B-OH
also O 
got O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
30'' O
HD O
Monitor O 
, O
which O 
really O
helps O
to O
extend O 
my B-OH
screen O 
and O
keep O
my B-OH
eyes O
fresh	O

The O
machine O 
is O
slow O
to O
boot O
up O
and O
occasionally O 
crashes O
completely O	 

After O
paying O
several O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
this O
service O
, O
it O
is O
frustrating O 
that O
you O
can O
not O
get O
help O
after O
hours	O 

I B-OH
love O
the O
operating O 
system O
and O
the O
preloaded O 
software O	

The O
best O
thing O
abO O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
price O
along O
with O
some O
of O
the O
newer O
features O	

YOU O
WILL O
NOT O
BE O
ABLE O
TO O
TALK O
TO O
AN O
AMERICAN O
WARRANTY O
SERVICE O
IS O
O O
OF O
COUNTRY O	

but O
now O
i B-OH
have O
realized O 
its O
a O
problem O 
with O
this O
brand	O 

Also O
kinda O
loud O
when O
the O
fan O
was O
running O	

There O
also O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
problem O 
with O
the O
hard O
disc O
as O
certain O 
times O
windows O
loads O
but O
claims O
to O
not O
be O
able O
to O
find O
any O
drivers O 
or O
files	O       

Speaking O
of O
the O
browser O 
, O
it O
too O
has O
problems O	 

The O
keyboard O 
is O
too O
slick	O 

It's O
like O
9 O
punds O 
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
look O
past O
it O
, O
it's O
GREAT	O

It's O
just O
as O
fast O
with O
one O
program O 
open O
as O
it O
is O
with O
sixteen O
open O

Still O
under O
warrenty O
so O
called O 
Toshiba O
, O
no O
help O
at O
all O

Amazing O
Quality O	

A O
month O 
or O
so O
ago O
, O
the O
freaking O 
motherboard O
just O
died O

The O
system O
it O
comes O
with O
does O
not O
work O
properly O 
, O
so O
when O
trying O
to O
fix O
the O
problems O 
with O
it O
it O
started O 
not O
working O 
at O
all O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O 
the O
charger O 
stopped O
working O
so O
I B-OH
was O 
forced O
to O
go O
O O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware O 
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O 
running O 

If O
a O
website O 
ever O
freezes O
( O
which O 
is O
rare O
) O
, O
its O
really O
easy O
to O
force O
quit O

I B-OH
also O
enjoy O
the O
fact O
that O
my B-OH
MacBook O
Pro O
laptop O
allows O
me B-OH
to O
run O
Windows O 
7 O
on O
it O
by O
using O
the O
VMWare O
program O  

I B-OH
wanted O 
to O
purchase O 
the O
extended O
warranty O
and O
they O
refused O
, O
because O 
they O
knew O
it O
was O
trouble O	

We B-OH
upgraded O 
the O
memory O
to O
four O
gigabytes O 
in O
order O
to O
take O
advantage O 
of O
the O
performace O 
increase O
in O
speed	O 

The O
reality O 
was O
, O
it O
heated O 
up O
very O
quickly O
, O
and O
took O
way O
too O
long O
to O
do O
simple O 
things O
, O
like O
opening O
my O
Documents O 
folder O	 

I B-OH
had O 
always O
used O
PCs O
and O
been O
constantly O 
frustrated O
by O
the O
crashing O 
and O
the O
poorly O
designed O
operating O
systems O
that O
were O
never O
very O
intuitive O	

Then O
, O
within O 
5 O
months O 
, O
the O
charger O 
crapped O
O O
on O
me B-OH  

And O
if O
you O
have O
a O
iphone O 
or O
ipod O
touch O
you O
can O
connect O 
and O
download O 
songs O
to O
it O
at O
high O
speed	O 

I B-OH
love O 
the O
glass O
touchpad O	

I B-OH
continued O
to O
take O
the O
computer O 
in O
AGAIN O
and O
they O
replaced O 
the O
hard O
drive O
and O
mother O
board O
yet O
again	O

Then O
HP O
sends O
it O
back O
to O
me O
with O
the O
hardware O 
screwed O
up O
, O
not O
able O
to O
connect O	

Oh O
yeah O
, O
don't O 
forget O
the O
expensive O 
shipping O
to O
and O
from O
HP O

Everything O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
Mac O
software O 
is O
just O
so O
much O
simpler O
than O
Microsoft O 
software O

And O
if O
you O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
writing O 
, O
editing O 
is O
a O
problem O 
since O
there O
is O
no O
forward O 
delete O
key O

Its O
ease O
of O
use O
and O
the O
top O

Apple- O

their O

or O
bellying O

It O
has O
a O
10 O
hour O
battery O
life O
when O
you O
're O
doing O
web O
browsing O 
and O
word O
editing O
, O
making O 
it O
perfect O 
for O
the O
classroom O 
or O
office O 
, O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
gaming O 
and O
movie O
playing O
it O
'll O
have O
a O
battery O 
life O
of O
just O
over O
5 O
hours	O 

Acer O
has O
set O
me B-OH
up O
with O
FREE O
recovery O 
discs O
, O
when O
they O
are O
available O 
since O
I B-OH
asked	O 

Enabling O
the O
battery O 
timer O
is O
useless O	

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
purchase O 
virus O
protection O 
for O
Mac O
, O
which O 
saves O
me B-OH
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
money	O

But O
we B-OH
had O
paid O
for O
bluetooth O
, O
and O
there O
was O
none O

It O
is O
always O 
reliable O
, O
never O 
bugged O
and O
responds O 
well O

they O
had O
to O
replace O 
the O
motherboard O 
in O
April O 

Also O
, O
if O
you O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
a O
representive O 
at O
Microsoft O 
, O
there O 
is O
a O
charge O
, O
which O 
I B-OH
believe O
is O
robbery O 
, O
since O 
you O
are O
charged O 
enormous O
amounts O
for O
a O
very O
badly O
designed O
system O
, O
which O
most O
people O
would O
have O
went O
with O
XP O
if O
they O
could	O 

I B-OH
love O 
WIndows O
7 O
which O 
is O
a O
vast O
improvment O 
over O
Vista	O

Dell's O
customer O
disservice O
is O
an O
insult O 
to O
it's O
customers O 
who O
pay O
good O
money O
for O
shoddy O
products O	

After O
talking O
it O
over O
with O
the O
very O
knowledgeable O 
sales O
associate O 
, O
I B-OH
chose O 
the O
MacBook O 
Pro O
over O
the O
white O
MacBook O	

If O
you O
really O
want O
a O
bang-up O 
system O
and O
don't O
need O
to O
run O
Windows O 
applications O 
, O
go O
with O
an O
Apple O 

You O
won't O
have O
to O
spend O
gobs O
of O
money O
on O
some O
inefficient O 
virus O
program O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
updated O 
every O
month O
and O
that O
constantly O 
drains O
your O
wallet O	 

It's O
color O
is O
even O
cool O

keys O
are O
all O
in O
weird O
places O
and O
is O
way O
too O
large O
for O
the O
way O
it O
is O
designed O	

Yes O
, O
a O
Mac O
is O
much O
more O
money O
than O
the O
average O 
laptop O
O O
there O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O 
in O
style O
, O
speed O 
and O
just O
cool O
factor O	

And O
not O
to O
mention O 
after O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
or O
so O
, O
the O
battery O 
will O
slowly O
less O
and O
less O
hold O
a O

until O
you O
can't O

thing O
I B-OH
might O
add O
is O
the O
battery O 
life O
is O
excellent O

One O
drawback O
, O
I B-OH
wish O 
the O

I B-OH
wish O
the O

be O
louder O 
and O
the O

didnt O
break O
after O
only O
a O

I B-OH
play O
a O
lot O
of O
casual O

online O
, O
and O
the O

very O

It O

everything O 
I B-OH
'd O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O
from O
a O
look O

but O
somehow O 
a O
bit O
more O
sturdy O	

the O
only O
fact O
i B-OH
dont O
like O
abO O
apples O
is O
they O
generally O 
use O

and O
i B-OH
dont O
use O

after O

I B-OH
would O
not O
hesitate O 
to O
purchase O 
this O
laptop O
again	O 

I B-OH
've O
been O
impressed O
with O
the O
battery O 
life O
and O
the O
performance O 
for O
such O
a O
small O 
amount O
of O
memory O	

It's O
applications O 
are O
terrific O 
, O
including O 
the O
replacements O 
for O
Microsoft O 
office O	

I B-OH
got O
it O
back O
and O
my O
built-in O

were O
shorting O 
O O
anytime O 
I B-OH
touched O
the O

, O
( O
mind O
you O
this O
was O
my B-OH
means O
of O
communication O 
with O
my B-OH
fiance O
who O
was O
deployed O 
) O
but O
I B-OH
suffered O 
thru O
it O
and O
would O
constandly O
have O
to O
reset O
the O
computer O 
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
my B-OH

Out O

The O

shortly O 
after O

to O
to O
get O
it O
fixed	O 

I B-OH
ordered O
through O
MacMall O
, O
which O 
saved O
me B-OH
the O
sales O
tax O
I B-OH
would O
have O
incurred O 
buying O
locally O

Of O
course O 
, O
I B-OH
also O
have O
several O
great O
software O
packages O
that O
came O
for O
free O
including O 
iWork O
, O
GarageBand O 
, O
and O
iMovie O	

The O
screen O
is O
very O
large O
and O
crystal O 
clear O
with O
amazing O
colors O
and O
resolution O

After O
a O
little O 
more O
than O
a O
year O
of O
owning O 
my B-OH
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
the O
monitor O 
has O
completely O 
died O

The O
brand O
of O
iTunes O 
has O
just O
become O
ingrained O
in O
our O
lexicon O 
now O
, O
but O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
Apple O
started O
it O
all O

Size O
: O
I B-OH
know O
13 O
is O
small O
( O
especially O 
for O
a O
desktop O 
replacement O 
) O
but O
with O
an O
external O
monitor O
, O
who O
cares	O 

The O
display O 
is O
incredibly O 
bright O
, O
much O
brighter O 
than O
my B-OH
PowerBook O
and O
very O
crisp	O 

The O
start O
menu O
is O
not O
the O
easiest O 
thing O
to O
navigate O 
due O
to O
the O
stacking O	

Really O
like O
the O
textured O 
surface O
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O	

The O
screen O
is O
bright O 
and O
the O
keyboard O 
is O
nice O

But O
the O
machine O 
is O
awesome O 
and O
iLife O
is O
great O
and O
I B-OH
love O
Snow O
Leopard O
X O

I B-OH
thought O
learning O
the O
Mac O
OS O
would O
be O
hard O
, O
but O
it O
is O
easily O 
picked O
up O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O 
with O
a O
PC O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
lightweight	O

They O
also O
have O
a O
longer O 
service O
life O
than O
other O
computers O 
( O
I B-OH
have O
several O
friends O
who O
still O
use O
the O
older O
Apple O
PowerB-perooks O 
) O

If O
you O
check O
you O
will O
find O
the O
same O
notebook O 
with O
the O
above O
missing O
ports O
and O
a O
dual O
core O
AMD O
or O
Intel O
processor O	

This O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O 
price O
and O
has O
a O
sleek O 
look O

I B-OH
especially O
like O
the O
keyboard O 
which O
has O
chiclet O 
type O
keys O

I B-OH
bought O
a O
protector O 
for O
my B-OH
key O
pad O
and O
it O
works O
great O
: O
) O

The O
magnetic O 
plug-in O
power O
charging O
power O
cord O
is O
great O
( O
I B-OH
even O 
put O
it O
to O
the O
test O
by O
accident O 
) O
- O
excellent O
innovation	O 

While O
Apple's O
saving O
grace O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
at O
least O
stand O
behind O
their O
products O
, O
and O
their O
support O
is O
great O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
their O
products O
were O
more O
reliable O 
to O
justify O 
the O
premium O	

only O
good O
thing O
is O
the O
graphics O 
quality O

The O
other O
lock-up O
problems O
are O
from O
a O
myriad O 
of O
causes O 
, O
the O
most O
common O
being O
a O
corrupted O 
version O
of O
Appleworks O 
which O
can O
render O
the O
browser O 
useless O 

The O
paint O
wears O
off O
easily O
due O
to O
the O
keyboard O 
being O
farther O
back O
than O
usual	O

The O
store B-OH
honored O
their O
warrenty O
and O
made O
the O
comment O 
that O
they O
don't O
even O
recommend O 
the O
HP O
brand O
because O
of O
the O
problems O 
with O
their O
warrentys O	

They O
sent O
Out O
the O
box O
right O
away O
for O
me B-OH
to O
send O
in O
my B-OH
computer O 
, O
they O
paid O
postage O
and O
whatnot O 
, O
but O
when O
I B-OH
got O
my O
computer O 
back O
it O
still O
wasn't O
running O
right O
, O
and O
now O
my O
CD O
drive O
wasn't O
reading O
anything O 

But O
the O
screen O
size O
is O
not O
that O
bad O
for O
email O
and O
web O
browsing O

On O
my O
PowerBook O 
G4 O
I B-OH
would O
never O
use O
the O
trackpad O 
I B-OH
would O
use O
an O
external O 
mouse O
because O
I B-OH
didn't O
like O
the O
trackpad O

This O
computer O 
doesn't O
do O
that O
well O
with O
certain O
games O
it O
can't O
play O
some O
and O
it O
becomes O 
too O
hot O
while O
playing O
games	O 

Yeah O
, O
of O
course O 
smarty O
pants O
`` O
fix O
it O
now O
'' O

Software O
- O
Compared O 
to O
the O
early O
2011 O
edition O
I B-OH
did O
see O
inbuilt O 
applications O 
crashing O
and O
it O
prompted O 
me B-OH
to O
send O
the O
report O
to O
Apple O
( O
which O 
I B-OH
promptly O
did O
) O

The O
body O
is O
a O
bit O
cheaply O 
made O
so O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O 
to O
see O
how O
long O
it O
holds O
up O

With O
a O
mac O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
antivirus O 
software O
or O
firewall O 
, O
it's O
so O
wonderful O	

Am O
very O
glad O
I B-OH
bought O
it O
, O
great O 
netbook O
, O
low O
price	O

The O
Apple O
team O
also O
assists O
you O
very O
nicely O
when O
choosing O 
which O
computer O
is O
right O
for O
you O
: O
) O

I B-OH
think O
part O
of O
the O
problem O 
with O
this O
computer O 
is O
Vista O
, O
yet O
I B-OH
know O
Vista O
isn't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my B-OH
latest O
purchase O
was O
my B-OH
Acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O
Vista O
( O
I B-OH
should O 
have O
waited O
the O
few O
months O
to O
get O
the O
next O
operating O 
system O
) O

The O
video O
chat O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
iffy O
abO O
it O
but O
im O
sure O
once O
they O
unpdate O
the O
next O
version O
on O
the O
macbook O 
book O
the O
quality O 
of O
it O
will O
be O
better O	

That O
whole O
experience O 
was O
just O
ridiculous O 
we B-OH
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we B-OH
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we B-OH
were O
like O
we B-OH
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse O
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O 
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we B-OH
paid O 
the O
$ O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed	O 

Fan O
vents O
to O
the O
side O
, O
so O
no O
cooling O 
pad O
needed O
, O
great O 
feature O	

i B-OH
use O
my B-OH
mac O
all O
the O
time O
, O
i B-OH
love O
the O
software O
, O
the O
way O
it O
takes O
a O
short O 
time O
to O
load O
things O
, O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
use O
and O
most O
of O
all O
how O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O	

Wasted O
me B-OH
at O
least O
8 O
hours O 
of O
installation O 
time O

It O
has O
far O
exceeded O 
my B-OH
expectations O 
for O
power O
, O
storage O 
, O
and O
abilitiy O	

I B-OH
am O
enjoying O 
it O
and O
the O
quality O 
it O
provides O 
is O
great	O

Suffice O
it O
to O
say O
, O
my B-OH
MacBook O 
Pro O
keeps O
me B-OH
going O
with O
its O
long O
battery O
life O
and O
blazing O 
speed	O

The O
OS O
is O
also O
very O
user O
friendly O 
, O
even O
for O
those O
that O
switch O
from O
a O
PC O
, O
with O
a O
little O 
practice O
you O
can O
take O
full O
advantage O 
of O
this O
OS O

iTunes O
is O
a O
handy O 
music-management O 
program O
, O
and O
it O
is O
essential O 
for O
anyone O
with O
an O
iPod O

the O
programs O 
are O
esay O
to O
use O
and O
are O
quick O
to O
process O 
this O
computer O 
works O
like O
a O
charm	O  

Tech B-OH
support I-OH
tells O
me O
the O
latter O
problem O
is O
a O
power O 
supply O
problem O
and O
have O
offered O
to O
fix O
it O
if O
it O
happens O 
again	O

Sells O
for O
the O
same O
as O
a O
netbook O 
withO O
sacrificing O 
size O

Windows O
XP O
SP2 O
caused O
many O
problems O 
on O
the O
computer O 
, O
so O
I B-OH
had O
to O
remove O 
it O

this O
is O
my B-OH
second O 
one O
and O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
bad O
video O
card O
unreliable O 
overall O
, O
this O
will O
be O
my B-OH
second O 
time O
returning O 
this O
laptop O
back O
to O
best O
buy O

With O
awesome O
graphics O
and O
assuring O 
security O
, O
it's O
perfect O	 

The O
laptop O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
set O
up O

I B-OH
recommend O
for O
word O
processing O 
and O
internet O 
users	O

Since O
I B-OH
've O
had O
this O
computer O 
I B-OH
've O
only O
used O
the O
trackpad O 
because O
it O
is O
so O
nice O
and O
smooth O	

A O
longer O 
battery O
life O
would O
have O
been O
great O
- O
but O
it O
meets O
it's O
spec O
quite O
easily O	

Who O
couldn't O 
love O
a O
DVD O
burner O
, O
80-gigabyte O 
HD O
, O
and O
fairly O
new O
graphics O
chip O
? O
As O
I B-OH
soon O
discovered O 
, O
though O 
, O
there O 
is O
a O
reason O 
for O
which O
similarly-configured O
Sony O
and O
Toshiba O 
machines O
cost O
more O
: O
they O
use O
higher-quality O 
components O
that O
are O
faster O
, O
better-configured O
, O
and O
end O
up O
lasting O 
a O
lot O
longer O	

The O
computer O 
itself O
was O
fast O
, O
ran O
smoothly O 
, O
and O
had O
no O
problems O	

Like O
the O
price O
and O
operation O

The O
brand O
is O
tarnished O 
in O
my B-OH
heart	O 

This O
is O
likely O 
due O
to O
poor O
grounding O 
and O
isolation O 
between O
the O
components O 
, O
and O
I B-OH
'm O
hoping O 
that O
it O
can O
be O
fixed O
with O
a O
ground O
loop O
isolator O 
, O
but O
I B-OH
still O
expected O
better O
product O
quality O
for O
this O
price O
range	O 

I B-OH
have O
had O
it O
for O
abO O
a O
1 O
1/2 O
and O
yes O
I B-OH
have O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
it O
one O
month O
O O
of O
warranty O	

Once O
open O
, O
the O
leading O 
edge O
is O
razor O
sharp	O 

Maximum O
sound O
isn't O
nearly O
as O
loud O
as O
it O
should O 
be O

I B-OH
loaded O
windows O
7 O
via O
Bootcamp O 
and O
it O
works O
flawlessly O

Great O
Laptop O
for O
the O
price O
, O
works O 
well O
with O
action O
pack O
games	O 

Although O
the O
price O
is O
higher O 
then O
Dell O
laptops O
, O
the O
Macbooks O 
are O
worth O
the O
dough	O 

So O
what O
if O
the O
laptops/mobile O 
phones O
look O
chic O
and O
cool O
? O
The O
after O
sales O
support O
is O
terrible O	

I B-OH
hate O
the O
display O 
screen O
and O
I B-OH
have O
done O
everything O 
I B-OH
could O
do O
the O
change O
it O

I B-OH
also O
like O
the O
acer O
arcade O
but O
these O
were O
really O
the O
only O
two O
things O
I B-OH
liked O
abO O
this O
laptop O	

Have O
not O
yet O
needed O
any O
customer O 
support O
with O
this O
yet O
so O
to O
me B-OH
that O
is O
a O
great O 
thing O
, O
which O 
is O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
ahead O
of O
PC O
in O
my B-OH
opinion O	

I B-OH
gave O
it O
to O
my B-OH
daughter O
because O
I B-OH
just O
hated O
the O
screen O
, O
hated O 
that O
it O
had O
no O
cd O
drive O
to O
at O
least O
play O
cd's O
when O
I B-OH
wanted O
to O
listen O 
to O
music O
and O
do O
schoolwork O

It O
runs O
very O
quiet O
too O
which O
is O
a O
plus O 

but O
it O
has O
a O
major O 
design O
flaw O

It O
was O
heavy O
, O
bulky O 
, O
and O
hard O
to O
carry O
because O
of O
the O
size O

The O
games O
included O
are O
very O
good O
games	O  

this O
computer O 
will O
last O
you O
at O
least O
7 O
years O 
, O
thats O 
an O
amazing O 
life O
spanned O
an O
electronic O 

Three O
, O
the O
mac O
book O
has O
advantages O 
over O
pcs' O
with O
linux O
based O
os O
there O
is O
very O
few O
problems O 
with O
system O
performance O 
when O
it O
comes O
to O
a O
mac O

A O
mac O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
it O
simply O 
makes O
sense	O 

It O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
use O

It O
is O
so O
nice O
not O
to O
worry O
abO O
that O
and O
the O
extra O
expense O
that O
comes O
along O
with O
the O
necessary O 
virus O
protection O 
on O
PC's O

The O
processor O 
screams O
, O
and O
because O 
of O
the O
unique O
way O
that O
Apple O
OSX O
16 O
functions O 
, O
most O
of O
the O

are O
rOed O
through O
the O

rather O

the O

that O
we B-OH
could O
hook O
it O
up O
directly O 
to O
our O
TV O 

The O
price O
premium O
is O
a O
little O 
much O
, O
but O
when O
you O
start O
looking O
at O
the O
features O 
it O
is O
worth O
the O
added O
cash O

I B-OH
can't O
say O
enough O
of O
how O
satisfied O 
I B-OH
am O
with O
their O
product O
and O
help O
aftermarket	O

I B-OH
connect O
a O
LaCie O 
2B-perig O
external O

via O
the O
firewire O 
800 O

, O
which O 
is O
useful O 
for O
Time O
Machine O	

I B-OH
am O
overall O 
very O
pleased O
with O
my B-OH
toshiba O
satellite O
, O
I B-OH
like O
the O
extra O
features O
, O
I B-OH
love O
the O
windows O 
7 O
home O
premium O	

The O
battery O 
life O
was O
shorter O 
than O
expected O	

The O
keyboard O 
is O
top O
notch	O 

The O
image O
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
soud O
is O
excelent O	

It O
is O
well O

Upgrading O

Starter O 
, O
thru O
Windows O
7 O
Home O
Premium O
, O
to O
Windows O 
7 O
Professional O 
was O
a O
snap O

I B-OH
had O
upgraded O 
my B-OH
old O
MacB-perook O 
to O
Lion O
, O
so O
I B-OH
kind O
of O
knew O
what O
I B-OH
was O
getting O 
, O
but O
hadn't O
been O
able O
to O
enjoy O
some O
of O
the O
awesome O 
new O
multi-touch O 
features O

The O
screen O
is O
a O
little O 
glary O
, O
and O
I B-OH
hated O
the O
clicking O 
buttons O
, O
but O
I B-OH
got O
used O
to O
them O 

Not O
to O
mention O 
, O
the O
battery O 
life O
is O
absolutely O 
amazing O

Now O
for O
the O
hardware O 
problems O

It's O
fast O
and O
has O
excellent O
battery O
life O

Apple O
care O
included O

Windows O
is O
also O
rather O
unsteady O
on O
its O
feet O
and O
is O
susceptible O 
to O
many O
bugs O

DO O
NOT O
BUY O
GATEWAY O 
COMPUTERS O
THEY O
ARE O
JUNK O
AND O
THE O
WARRANTY O 
COMPANY O
IS O
HORRIBLE O	

The O
only O
bad O
part O
is O
the O
size O
/ O
weight O	

The O
little O
battery O
that O
it O
did O
have O
would O
only O
last O
abO O
an O
hour O
while O
just O
having O
it O
on O
the O
desktop O

I B-OH
liked O 
the O
aluminum O 
body O

Its O
good O
for O
playing O 
my O
apps O
on O
Facebook O 
or O
watching O 
movies O

From O
the O
build O
quality O
to O
the O
performance O 
, O
everything O 
about O
it O
has O
been O
sub-par O
from O
what O
I B-OH
would O
have O
expected O 
from O
Apple	O 

I B-OH
love O
the O
dock O
where O
I B-OH
can O
simply O
drop O
a O
file O
ontop O
of O
a O
particular O 
program O
, O
and O
the O
program O 
will O
simply O
open O
that O
file O

pretty O
much O
everything O 
else O
abO O
the O
computer O 
is O
good O
it O
just O
stops O
working O
O O
of O
no O
were O

It O
was O
truly O
a O
great O 
computer O
costing O
less O
than O
one O
thousand O 
bucks O
before O
tax O

Waiting O
for O
the O
i7 O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
, O
great O 
value O
for O
the O
price	O 

Boots O
up O
fast O
and O
runs O
great	O 

Lightweight O
and O
the O
screen O
is O
beautiful O

The O
Macbook O 
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin O
packing O
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
, O
all O
the O
functions O 
works O
great	O 

They B-OH
say O
sorry O
O O
of O
warranty O

After O
having O
two O
PC O
laptops O 
die O
with O
in O
the O
past O
3 O
years O 
, O
I B-OH
was O
led O
to O
the O
Apple O
display O
at O
Best O
Buy O
by O
the O
sleek O
design O
and O
promise O 
of O
less O
tech O
issues O 

The O
service O 
I B-OH
received O
from O
Toshiba O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
the O
call O
of O
duty O

Have O
had O
many O
higher O
priced O
computers O
crash O
and O
burn O
long O
before O
ever O
got O
to O
use O
all O
that O
great O 
memory O
and O
speed O
, O
etc O

I B-OH
would O
recommend O 
it O
just O
because O
of O
the O
internet O 
speed O
probably O
because O
thats O
the O
only O
thing O
i B-OH
really O 
care O
about O

The O
screen O
shows O
great O
colors O

Reason O
why O
? O
It's O
because O
when O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
you O
know O
first O
thing O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
any O
value O
for O
that O
laptop O
, O
the O
price O
will O
stay O
the O
same O
for O
the O
next O
year O
, O
and O
even O
if O
Apple O
does O
decides O
to O
change O 
mode O
, O
your O
laptop O
value O
will O
only O
drop O
10-20 O
% O
, O
unlike O 
PC O
laptops O 
which O
drop O
more O
than O
80 O
% O

The O
17 O
inch O
screen O
is O
very O
large O
, O
but O
the O
computer O 
is O
very O
light	O 

My B-OH
opinion O
of O
Sony O
has O
been O
dropping O 
as O
fast O
as O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
given O 
their O
horrible O
support O
, O
but O
this O
machine O
just O
caused O
another O
plunge O	

For O
the O
Bluetooth O 
to O
work O
properly O 
, O
you O
must O
install O
the O
Launch O
Manager O
on O
the O
Drivers/Applications O 
DVD O
, O
or O
it O
will O
not O
show O
after O
the O
reload O	

I B-OH
also O 
liked O
the O
glass O
screen O	

The O
switchable O 
graphic O
card O
is O
pretty O 
sweet O
when O
you O
want O
gaming O
on O
the O
laptop O	

The O
battery O 
life O
has O
not O
decreased O 
since O
I B-OH
bought O
it O
, O
so O
i B-OH
'm O
thrilled O 
with O
that O

When O
I B-OH
called O
Toshiba O
, O
they O
would O
not O
do O
anything O 
and O
even O
tried O
to O
charge O 
me B-OH
$ O
35 O
for O
the O
phone O
call O
, O
even O
though O
they O
didn't O
offer O
any O
technical O 
support O	

I B-OH
bought O 
this O
notebook O 
and O
only O
had O
it O
for O
3 O
months O 
If O
it O
is O
overload O 
with O
updates O
the O
BOOT O
MGR O

Oh O
and O
if O
thats O
not O
bad O
enough O
it O
doesn't O 
come O
with O
a O
recovery O 
cd O
so O
you O
can O
make O
one O
if O
you O
know O
how O
to O
or O
buy O
one O
if O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
cost O
is O
$ O
25 O
for O
two O
cds O 

The O
price O
and O
features O 
more O
than O
met O
my B-OH
needs	O

Skype O
is O
just O
so O
dang O
cool O
with O
this O
machine O
too O

Also O
, O
HDD O
secures O 
inside O
using O
rails O
, O
and O
there O
is O
only O
one O
set O
on O
the O
main O
hard O
drive	O  

All O
I B-OH
will O
say O
now O
is O
that O
it O
was O
over O
two O
grand O
less O
expensive O 
and O
so O
much O
better O
quality O
than O
my B-OH
hunk O
of O
crap O
Vaio O

Games O
being O
the O
main O
issue	O 

They B-OH
say O
that O
this O
will O
invalidate O 
the O
warranty O 
on O
the O
hard O
drive O
( O
I B-OH
don't O 
really O
understand O 
why O
but O
anyway O
) O

A O
great O 
computer O
for O
light O
home O
use O
and O
business O 
use O

Also O
consider O 
the O
MS O
Office O 
apps O
are O
all O
trial O
versions O
, O
hope O
you O
have O
your O
own O
copies O	

Even O
so O
, O
I B-OH
like O
playing O
online O
games O
, O
so O
it O
was O
wonderful O 
that O
there O
is O
a O
feature O 
where O
I B-OH
can O
dualboot O 
Windows O

The O
battery O 
life O
is O
amazingly O 
long O
at O
7hrs O
and O
5hrs O
if O
you O
use O
it O

lightweight O
, O
long O
battery O
life O
, O
excellent O 
transition O
from O
PC O

The O
Nortons O 
virus O
scan O
is O
only O
for O
a O
very O
short O
time O
unlike O
others O
that O
usually O
are O
good O
for O
a O
year O

I B-OH
am O
first O
time O
Mac O
Buyer O
and O
am O
amazed O 
at O
features O 
and O
ease O
of O
use O
the O
Mac O
offers O	

Came O
fully O
loaded O
- O
good O

I B-OH
noticed O
windows O
has O
a O
new O
system O
called O
Windows O
7 O
, O
what O
abO O
us O
Vista O
users O
? O
They O
should O
get O
all O
the O
bugs O
O O
of O
Vista O
before O
investing O
in O
a O
new O
system O	

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I B-OH
have O
, O
is O
the O
key O
broad O
is O
a O
little O 
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O 
, O
would O 
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O 
lighter O
then O
it O
is O

This O
is O
the O
complete O 
opposite O
to O
an O
ergonomic O 
design O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I B-OH
don't O
like O
abO O
my B-OH
mac O
is O
that O
sometimes O 
there O
are O
programs O 
that O
I B-OH
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
and O
I B-OH
am O
not O
able O
to O

Wireless O
has O
not O
been O
a O
issue O 
for O
me B-OH
, O
like O
some O
others O
have O
meantioned O

MacBook O
Notebooks O
quickly O
die O
O O
because O 
of O
their O
short O
battery O
life O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
many O
background O 
programs O
that O
run O
without O 
the O
user's O
knowlede O

All O
the O
things O
you O
can O
do O
with O
the O
trackpad O 
make O
navigating O 
around O
the O
computer O 
and O
its O
programs O 
so O
much O
simpler O
, O
quicker O 
, O
and O
easier O	

I B-OH
guess O
the O
only O
good O
thing O
that O
came O
O O
of O
these O
were O
the O
speakers O 
and O
the O
subwoofer O 

Theres O
a O
built O 
in O
camera O 
with O
special O
effects- O
for O
video O
and O
photography	O 

All O
for O
such O
a O
great O 
price	O 

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
after O
only O
a O
month O 
the O
left O
mouse O
key O
broke O
and O
it O
costed O 
$ O
175 O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
fix O
it O

It O
has O
good O
speed O
and O
plenty O
of O
hard O
drive O
space	O 

Very O
long-life O 
battery O
( O
up O
to O
10-11 O
hours O
depending O 
on O
how O
you O
configure O 
power O
level O
settings O
) O

The O
black O
model O
also O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
seamless O 
appearance O
- O
one O
of O
the O
better O
looking O
notebooks O
I B-OH
've O
seen O

The O
technical O 
service O
for O
dell O
is O
so O
3rd O
world O
it O
might O
as O
well O
not O
even O
bother O	

The O
graphics O 
were O
awful O
and O
the O
warranty O 
isn't O
even O
worth O
the O
cheap O
payment O
on O
the O
computer O	

They O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
yet O
again O
, O
but O
their O
was O
a O
malfunction O 
in O
the O
battery O 
itself O
, O
it O
didn't O 
die O

If O
you O
don't O
feel O
comfortable O 
doing O
it O
yourself O 
, O
just O
buy O
the O
case O
and O
be O
happy O
, O
plus O
it O
looks O
nice O
, O
I B-OH
bought O

Best O
Buy O

Excellent O

for O
my B-OH
finances O 
, O
scheduling O 
, O
my B-OH
parents O 
business O
expenses O
, O
and O
it O
is O
definitely O 
amazing O
for O
gaming O

I B-OH
was O
taught O
to O
use O
Photoshop O 
and O
was O
amazed O

The O
driver O
updates O
don't O
fix O
the O
issue O
, O
very O
frustrating	O 

It O
doesn't O 
work O
worth O
a O
damn O

It O
works O
really O
well O

Bigger O

and O
a O

The O
built O
in O
camera O 
is O
very O
useful O
when O
chatting O 
with O
other O
techs O
in O
remote O 
buildings O
on O
our O
campus O	

The O
DVD O

broke O
after O
burning O
3 O
DVD'd O 
during O
that O
time O

It O
works O
fine O
with O
our B-OH
wireless O 
and O
they O
've O
had O
not O
problems O	

Product O
support O
very O
poor O
as O
each O
phone O
call O
costs O
me B-OH
long O
distan O	

Overall O
the O
computer O 
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
the O
screen O
is O
perfect O 
, O
great O 
computer O
, O
my B-OH
daughter I-OH
loves	O

The O
casing O
of O
the O

fried O
and O
shocked O 
my B-OH
husband O
when O
he O
pulled O 
it O
O O
of O
the O

It O
does O
not O
keep O
internet O

no O
matter O 
where O
you O
bring O
it O

It's O
a O
great O 
product O
for O
a O
great O 
price	O  

But O
see O
the O
macbook O 
pro O
is O
different O 
because O
it O
may O
have O
a O
huge O
price O
tag O
but O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
full O

days O
after O
I B-OH
received O
the O

back O
, O
the O
screen O
froze O
again	O 

It O
is O
not O
ideal O
for O

of O
the O

Although O
i B-OH
do O
believe O 
that O

some O

The O
computer O 
runs O
very O
fast O
with O
no O
problems O 
and O
the O
iLife O
software O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
( O
iPhoto O

 ) O
is O
all O
very O
helpful O
as O
well O

At O
first O
it O
worked O 
well O
for O
a O
month O 
or O
so O
then O
the O
system O
board O
failed O
and O
I B-OH
send O
it O
in O
to O
toshiba O 
some O
complaints O 
and O
three O
weeks O
later O
I B-OH
then O
receive O
my B-OH
laptop O
back O
only O
to O
discover O 
that O
it O
still O
has O
the O
same O
problem O
so O
now O
I B-OH
have O
to O
send O
it O
back O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
again	O 

Until O
I B-OH
bought O
the O
Dell O
, O
I B-OH
thought O 
you O
just O
looked O
for O
what O
you O
wanted O
( O
size O
, O
software O 
, O
options O 
, O
hardware O 
) O
and O
purchase O 
the O
best O
deal O
you O
could O
find O

It O
has O
plenty O
of O
memory O 
, O
lots O
of O
hard O
drive O
, O
and O
great O
graphics O	

However O
, O
my B-OH
girlfriend I-OH
realized O 
that O
the O
netbook's O 
hinge O
is O
a O
bit O
loose O
( O
when O
you O
open O
or O
close O
the O
LCD O
) O

My B-OH
problem O
was O
with O
DELL O
Customer O 
Service O

Newegg's O
RMA O
service O 
was O
great O
as O
always O 
, O
I B-OH
contacted O 
them O
late O
Friday O
night O
, O
and O
they O
issued O
me B-OH
an O
RMA O
number O
and O
a O
PrePaid O

easy O

go O
from O

another O	

My B-OH
ONLY O
issues O
are O
: O
1 O
) O
the O
screen/video O 
resolution O
won't O
increase O
to O
a O
higher O 
resolution O 
then O
1024 O
x O
60 O

Its O
pretty O
fast O
and O
does O
not O
have O
hiccups O
while O
I B-OH
am O
using O
it O
for O
web O
browsing O 
, O

Quality O

I B-OH
love O
HP O
, O
, O
it's O
the O
only O
computer/printer O 
we B-OH
will O
buy O

the O
features O 
are O
great O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
it O
needs O
is O
better O 
speakers O	

I B-OH
bought O 
this O
laptop O
and O
found O
its O
TAB O
is O
not O
functioning	O

Called O
headquarters O 
again O
, O
they O
report O
that O
TFT O
panel O
is O
broken O 
, O
should O 
be O
fixed O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
( O
week O
3 O
) O

Navigation O
through O
the O
computer O 
is O
far O
superior O 
compared O
to O
Windows O 
operating O
systems O
, O
as O
well O

The O
screen O
is O
framed O 
by O
half- O
to O
a O
full-inch O 
margin O
that O
is O
obviously O 
unnecessary O
, O
reduces O 
the O
screen O
size O
and O
increases O 
the O
bulk O

I B-OH
had O
to O
re-install O 
Windows O
within O
two O
weeks O
of O
the O
purchase O 
and O
soon O
discovered O 
cracks O
in O
the O
screen O
hinges O

A O
SECOND O 
PROBLEM O
INVOLVES O
THE O

WHICH O
IS O
ADVERTISED O 
AS O
HAVING O 
A O

WHEN O

ONLY O
7 O
HOURS O 
OF O

and O
plenty O
of O

with O

( O
though O 
I B-OH
will O
upgrade O
this O
and O
the O
ram.O
. O
) O

Programs O
would O
crash O
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
it O
turned O 
O O
to O
be O
a O
very O
unstable O 
, O
unreliable O 
laptop O
for O
me B-OH

the O

take O
a O
little O 
getting O
used O

have O
loved O
the O
Macbook O

Keyboard O
is O
reasonable O
size O

Fan O
noise O
: O
The O
fan O
made O
a O
constant O 
hissing O
noise O
in O
the O
background O

The O
screen O
is O
bright O 
and O
clear O
, O
the O
operating O 
system O
is O
solid O
and O
friendly O
to O
a O
novice O	

It O
has O
a O
1 O
ghz O
faster O
processor O
and O
a O
stock O 
500gb O
hard O
drive	O 

This O
isn't O
a O
big O
deal O
, O
I B-OH
haven't O 
noticed O
the O
issue O
with O
DVDs O
or O
other O
media O
, O
only O
through O
USB O
Oput O

With O
Windows O
laptops O
a O
wireless O 
mouse O
is O
an O
absolute O 
must O

Very O
good O
quality O
and O
well O
made O

my B-OH
niece O
and O
nephew O
have O
played O
a O
few O
web O
games O
and O
it O
runs O
anything O 
that O
doesn't O
require O
a O
dedicated O 
video O
card O

It O
had O
the O
full O
sized O
touch O
pad O
with O
2 O
buttons O 
instead O
of O
just O
one O

Typically O
, O
when O
I B-OH
purchase O 
a O
new O
laptop O
I B-OH
always O
end O
up O
using O
an O
external O 
mouse O
for O
convenience	O 

It O
was O
super O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
and O
Is O
really O 
easy O
to O
get O
used O
to O	

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
be O
updated O 
is O
the O
video O
, O
other O 
than O
that O
you O
are O
all O
set O

Its O
a O
good O
laptop O
for O
its O
value	O 

Then O
the O
hard O
drive O
failed O	

of O
course O 
my B-OH
warranty O
runs O
out O
next O
month	O 

I B-OH
have O
found O
also O
, O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
be O
able O
to O
access O 
wireless O
internet O
access O

This O
is O
a O
great O 
value O
for O
the O
money	O 

The O
battery O 
has O
never O
worked O
well O

I B-OH
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
from O
Dell O
ever O
again O
do O
to O
how O
awful O
it O
worked O 
and O
how O
I B-OH
was O
treated O 
by O
the O
company O

Small O
enough O
to O
use O
on O
a O
long O
flight O
, O
Light O 
enough O
to O
carry O
through O
airports O
and O
powerful O 
enough O
to O
replace O 
my B-OH
desktop O
while O
on O
long O
business O 
trips	O

Typing O
on O
the O
keyboard O 
becomes O
uncomfortable O 
after O
extended O
use O
due O
to O
the O
sharp O
edges O
that O
your O
wrists O
rest O
on O

It O
has O
many O
great O
programs O
, O
such O
as O
ILife O
, O
iPhotos O 
and O
others O	

I B-OH
highly O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anybody O 
that O
wants O
great O
performance O 
from O
a O
laptop O 
and O
would O
like O
to O
relax O
and O
not O
become O
enraged O
cursing O
the O
gods O
about O
to O
throw O
your O
laptop O
out O
the O
door O

The O
screen O
resolution O 
was O
exactly O 
what O
I B-OH
was O
looking O 
for O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
running O 
Snow O
Leopard O
, O
2.4 O
GHz O
C2D O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
antiquated O 
CPU O
and O
thus O
the O
occasional O 
spinning O
wheel O
would O
appear O
when O
running O
Office O
Mac O
applications O 
such O
as O
Word O
or O
Excel	O 

There O
is O
no O
number O 
pad O
to O
the O
right O
of O
the O
keyboard O 
which O
is O
a O
bummer O	

If O
upgrade O 
is O
possible O 
to O
the O
full O
Windows O
7 O
, O
then O
I B-OH
will O
truly O
be O
a O
very O
happy O
geek O

I B-OH
was O
originally O 
concerned O
that O
I B-OH
couldn't O 
view O
work O
I B-OH
had O
done O
in O
college O 
on O
my B-OH
Mac O
because O 
of O
the O
PC O
formatting O 
, O
but O
I B-OH
was O
even O
more O
thrilled O 
to O
learn O
of O
programs O
like O
iLife O
and O
iWork O
that O
allow O
you O
to O
convert O
your O
PC O
documents O 
into O
readable O 
files O
on O
Macs O

Runs O
fast O
and O
the O
regular O 
layout O
keyboard O
is O
so O
much O
better O

All O
the O
programs O 
are O
easy O
and O
straight O 
forward O
on O
my B-OH
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
it O
is O
clean O
and O
organized O 
, O
which O 
I B-OH
always O
strive O
to O
be O
myself O	

Windows O
7 O
Starter O 
is O
terrific O 
( O
no O
you O
can't O
change O
the O
background O 
) O
but O
I B-OH
don't O
need O
to O
, O
I B-OH
use O
it O
just O
for O
school O
work O

Support O
has O
been O
lackluster O 
and O
now O
I B-OH
just O
want O
a O
refund O	

`` O
> O
iPhoto O 
is O
probably O 
the O
best O
program O
I B-OH
have O
ever O
worked O
with O
: O
easy O
and O
convenient O 

I B-OH
love O 
to O
write O
and O
play O
with O
graphics O 
and O
html O
programming O 
and O
my B-OH
new O
Toshiba O 
works O
great O
on O
both O

My B-OH
laptop O
now O
has O
no O
battery O	

It O
made O
the O
computer O 
much O
easier O
to O
use O
and O
navigate O	

Needs O
longer O
lasting O
battery O
, O
More O
than O
1 O
to O
2 O
Hrs O

in O
May O
I B-OH
started O 
having O
problems O
with O
the O
USB-per O
ports O
not O
working O	

The O
Mac O
version O 
of O
Microsoft O 
Office O
is O
cheaper O 
than O
buying O
the O
actual O
and O
works O
just O
as O
well O 

The O
Toshiba O 
Net O
book O
operates O 
very O
well O

the O
touch O
pad O
is O
fine O
- O
again O 
, O
it's O
a O
real O
touch O
pad O

The O
pictures O 
are O
clear O
as O
can O
be O

It O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O 
, O
making O 
transporting O 
this O
computer O 
very O
easy O

It's O
wonderful O 
for O
computer O 
gaming O

The O
flaws O
are O
, O
this O
computer O 
is O
not O
for O
computer O 
gamers O
because O
of O
the O
OS O
X O

They O
really O
do O
have O
the O
worlds O
very O
worst O
repair O
service O

I B-OH
was O
also O
able O
to O
install O 
and O
use O
my B-OH
Photoshop O
and O
AfterEffects O 
programs O
easily O

It's O
perfect O
for O
everything O 
and O
runs O
faster O
than O
an O
average O 
pc O

Then O
after O
paying O
for O
it O
to O
be O
examined O 
I B-OH
was O
told O
it O
was O
same O
problem O
cited O
on O
website O 
but O
I'd O
have O
to O
pay O
anyways O 
since O
it O
was O
past O
warrenty O	

I B-OH
'm O
already O 
hooked O
on O
the O
sleek O
look O
and O
dependability O 
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
shown	O

And O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
company O 
has O
been O
a O
even O
worse O
nightmare O	

It O
has O
all O
the O
features O 
that O
are O
necessary O 
for O
college O 
and O
if O
not O
they O
are O
able O
to O
be O
added O
onto O
the O
computer O	

I B-OH
've O 
owned O
this O
labtop O
for O
less O
then O
two O
months O
, O
already O 
the O
mouse O
button O
has O
broke	O

It O
did O
fairly O
well O
, O
other O 
than O
it's O
poor O
performance O 
, O
overheating O 
and O
occational O 
blue O
screen O	 

lots O
of O
extra O
space O
but O
the O
keyboard O
is O
ridiculously O 
small	O

It's O
so O
bad O
that O
I B-OH
'm O
thinking O 
I B-OH
only O
got O
half O
a O
battery O 
or O
something O

Good O
keyboard O 
, O
long O
battery O

, O
largest O 
hard O

and O

The O

is O
very O
quick O
and O
effective O 
as O
I B-OH
load O
webpages O 
and O
applications O	

My O
battery O 
went O
bad O
abO O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
after O
having O
it O
and O
it O
cost O
around O
eighty O
to O
a O
hundred O 
dollars O

It O
pretty O 
much O
does O
everything O 
we B-OH
could O
ever O
need O
, O
and O
looks O
great O
to O
boot O

As O
a O
lifelong O 
Windows O
user O
, O
I B-OH
was O
extremely O 
pleased O
to O
make O
the O
change O
to O
Mac O

The O
Macbook O 
is O
also O
made O
better O
, O
my B-OH
computer O 
has O
never O
got O
a O
virus O 
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
runs O
just O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
first O
day O
I B-OH
bought O
it O

I B-OH
wiped O
nearly O
everything O 
off O
of O
it O
, O
installed O 
OpenOffice O
and O
Firefox O 
, O
and O
I B-OH
am O
operating O 
an O
incredibly O 
efficient O
and O
useful O
machine O
for O
a O
great O 
price	O

Overall O
I B-OH
feel O
this O
netbook O
was O
poor O
quality O
, O
had O
poor O
performance O 
, O
although O 
it O
did O
have O
great O
battery O
life O
when O
it O
did O
work O

I B-OH
picked O
it O
O O
because O 
it O
was O
inexpensive O 
( O
$ O
400 O
) O
and O
I B-OH
thought O 
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
first O
laptop O	

MY B-OH
ONLY O
PROBLEM O
IS O
I B-OH
CAN O
NOT O
REG O
. O
THE O
PRODUCT O 
KEY O 

Sure O
it O
has O
the O
one O
touch O
keys O
but O
that O
was O
the O
best O
feature O
of O
the O
computer O	 

great O
battery O
life O

At O
first O
, O
the O
computer O 
seemed O
a O
great O 
deal O
-- O
seemingly O 
high-end O
specs O
for O
a O
low O
, O
low O
price	O 

Love O
the O
stability O 
of O
the O
Mac O
software O 
and O
operating O 
system O	

It's O
also O
very O
capable O
of O
doing O
moderate O
video O
editing O
( O
although O 
you O
may O
need O
the O
performance O 
boost O
of O
the O
larger O
MacBook O
Pros O
for O
heavy O
duty O
mobile O
video O
editing O
) O

It O
has O
a O
faster O 
processor O
and O
more O
ram O

Would O
like O
more O
trendy O
, O
high O
tech O
features O	

Keyboard O
is O
great O
but O
primary O 
and O
secondary O 
control O
buttons O
could O
be O
more O
durable O	

I B-OH
got O
it O
back O
again O
and O
was O
told O
the O
motherboard O 
had O
been O
replaced O
, O
so O
I B-OH
was O
now O
on O
the O
SECOND O
motherboard O
within O
3 O
months O	 

Love O
the O
speed O
, O
especially O

Not O
only O
are O
the O
versions O 
of O
these O
programs O
able O
to O
be O
saved O
, O
worked O 
on O
and O
opened O
on O
both O
a O
PC O
and O
Mac O
, O
the O
versions O 
of O
these O
programs O
on O
a O
Mac O
are O
graphically O 
and O
functionally O
superior O

The O
speed O
gives O
you O
the O
power O
to O
work O
on O
these O
projects O
seamlessly O
, O
and O
multiple O 
at O
a O
time O
if O
you O

Awesome O
laptop O
and O
the O
perfect O 
size O
to O
carry O
around O
in O
college O	

My B-OH
real O
problem O
with O
it O
? O
The O
statement O 
of O
7 O
hour O
battery O
life O
is O
not O
just O
mere O
exaggeration O 
-- O
it's O
a O
lie O

The O
battery O 
life O
is O
also O
relatively O 
good O

I B-OH
have O
found O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
very O
informative O 
, O
wonder O 
alerts O
and O
tutorials O 
making O
it O
very O
easy O
for O
someone O 
like O
me B-OH
who O
is O
not O
exactly O 
technologically O
advanced O
to O
learn O
to O
use O
the O
various O 
features O
and O
programs O

I B-OH
don't O
have O
stupid O
pop O
up O
windows O 
( O
even O
when O
I B-OH
have O
pop O
ups O
blocked O 
) O
, O
I B-OH
don't O 
have O
to O
wait O
5 O
minutes O 
for O
a O
webpage O 
to O
download O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
I B-OH
can O
run O
all O
the O
web O
programming O 
software O
I B-OH
need O
to O
use O
all O
at O
once O
withO O
slowing O
me B-OH
down O	 

Memory O
is O
upgradable O

Web O
access O
through O
the O
3G O
network O 
is O
so O
slow O
, O
it's O
very O
frustrating O 
and O
VERY O
DISAPPOINTING O	

The O
large O
screen O
also O
helps O
when O
you O
are O
working O 
in O
design O 
based O
programs O
like O
Adobe O
Creative O
Suite	O 

This O
is O
my B-OH
first O 
Dell O
I O
heard O 
their O
customer O
service O
was O
lacking O 
and O
that O
they O
were O
working O
on O
improving O
it O	

As O
well O
as O
having O 
the O
plug O
in O
the O
computer O 
come O
loose O

Second O

inside O
that O
need O
to O
be O
broken O 
if O
you O
what O

install O 
one O

Great O
product O
by O
Apple O
with O
the O
new O
great O
looking O
design O

I B-OH
love O
the O
keyboard O

I B-OH
use O
iphoto O
all O
the O
time O
, O
which O 
is O
a O
great O 
program O
for O
anyone O
who O
is O
into O
photography O 
- O
amateurs O 
and O
experts O 
alike	O

Now O
, O
as O
easy O
as O
it O
is O
to O
use O
, O
and O
I B-OH
do O
think O
it O
is O
a O
great O 
STARTER O
laptop O

Ever O
since O
I B-OH
bought O
this O
laptop O
, O
so O
far O
I B-OH
've O
experience O 
nothing O
but O
constant O 
break O
downs O
of O
the O
laptop O
and O
bad O
customer O 
services O
I B-OH
received O
over O
the O
phone O
with O
toshiba O
customer O
services O
hotlines O

Also O
, O
the O
space O
bar O
makes O
a O
noisy O 
click O
every O
time O
you O
use O
it O

iPhotos O
is O
an O
excellent O 
program O
for O
storing O 
and O
organizing O 
photos O

Other O
than O
that O
its O
a O
great O 
performing O 
machine O
and O
well O
meets O
all O
my B-OH
needs O
and O
more O

The O
programs O 
are O
great O
, O
like O
iphoto O
( O
love O
the O
editing O 
capabilities O
 ) O
, O
imail O 
( O
which O 
can O
incorporate O 
with O
the O
address O 
book O
on O
the O
ipod O
and O
ipad O
) O
, O
imovie O
, O
etc. O

Comfortable O
to O
use O
light O
easy O
to O
transport O

The O
Computer O 
itself O
is O
a O
good O
product O
but O
the O
repair O
depot O
stinks O	

I B-OH
thought O
the O
price O
was O
great O
for O
the O
specs	O

the O
only O
down O
fall O
is O
that O
it O
has O
no O
cd O
drive O
but O
i B-OH
found O
that O
they O
are O
very O
cheap O
to O
by O
and O
also O
very O
portable O 
making O
this O
the O
best O
friend O
to O
someone O 
who O
is O
always O 
looking O
for O
more O
space O
then O
they O
have O

So O
, O
the O
hard O
disk O
capacity O 
really O
doesn't O
matter O
to O
me B-OH

I B-OH
also O
like O
that O
you O
can O
scroll O
down O
in O
a O
window O 
using O
two O
fingers O 
on O
the O
trackpad O

Everything O
from O
the O
design O
to O
the O
OS O
is O
simple O 
and O
to O
the O
point	O 

I B-OH
personally O
like O
the O
gaming O
look O
but O
needed O
a O
machine O 
that O
delivered O 
gaming O
performance O 
while O
still O
looking O
professional O 
in O
front O
of O
my B-OH
customers O

This O
just O
keeps O
having O
it's O
hard O
drive O
replaced O	

When O
you O
look O
at O
the O
specs O
on O
Apple O
products O
in O
comparison O 
to O
a O
Dell O
or O
a O
HP O
, O
yes O
they O
do O
seem O
to O
offer O
less O
for O
a O
higher O
cost O	

The O
only O
downfall O 
is O
the O
volume O
control O

Very O
fast O
boot O
up O
and O
shut O
down O

I B-OH
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
laptop O
because O
it O
was O
the O
right O
price O
for O
what O
I B-OH
need O
it O

If O
internet O 
connectivity O 
is O
important O 
I B-OH
would O
recommend O 
going O
with O
a O
dell O
net O
book O
for O
50 O
bucks O
more O
, O
or O
buy O
a O
USB-per O
wireless O 
card O

I B-OH
had O
read O
online O
that O
some O
users O
were O
having O
sound O
problems O	

It O
discharges O 
too O
quickly O	

But O
to O
be O
honest O 
, O
the O
compatibility O 
issues O
and O
the O
other O
little O
quirks O
make O
me B-OH
think O 
I B-OH
ll O
buy O
a O
PC O
next O
time O

Then O
it O
ceased O 
charging O
at O
all O

I B-OH
do O
not O
experience O 
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
coming O
O O
of O
it O
, O
however O 
I B-OH 
would O 
highly O
suggest O
purchasing O
a O
stand O
however O
, O
due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
design O
of O
the O
macbook O 
as O
it O
is O
one O
very O
large O
heat O
sink O 

Webcam O
is O
a O
bit O
laggy O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O	 

I B-OH
've O
haven't O
had O
any O
major O
problems O
with O
the O
laptop O
except O
that O
the O
plastic O 
piece O
that O
covers O
the O
usb O
port O
wires O
have O
all O
come O
off O

Wonderful O
sleek O

only O
on O

Oside O	 

It O
is O
speedy O 
when O
connected O 
wirelessly O
to O
any O
network O 
regardless O
if O
the O
connection O 
is O
weak O
or O
not O

The O
pricing O 
is O
very O
competitive	O 

This O
computer O 
is O
exceptionally O
thin O
for O
it's O
screen O
size O
and O
processing O
power	O 

Maybe O
this O
is O
virus O
related O
, O
maybe O 
not O
, O
but O
the O
computer O 
has O
locked O
up O
many O
times O
, O
and O
on O
two O
occasions O 
, O
the O
screen O
has O
simply O
gone O
black	O 

The O

the O

What O
I B-OH
'd O
like O
is O
for O
the O
laptop O
to O
run O
well O
withO O
having O
to O
purchase O 
additional O
memory O

It O
is O
fast O
booting O
up O
, O
shutting O 
down O
, O
and O
connection O 
with O
the O
internet O	

This O
is O
not O
a O
serious O 
gaming O
laptop O
or O
a O
serious O 
media O
machine O 

They O
replaced O 
my B-OH
hard O 
drive O
as O
well O
as O
my B-OH
mother O 
board O

There O
is O
nothing O 
to O
complain O 
abO O
the O
system O

and O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
new O
OSX O
that O
comes O
with O
new O
features O 
that O
makes O
the O
use O
more O
easy O

Now O
the O
screen O
is O
going O
darker O
, O
darker O 
, O
darker O	

I B-OH
take O
it O
everywhere O 
with O
me B-OH
because O 
it's O
so O
easy O
to O
carry O

Oh O
and O
it O
has O
word O
and O
stuff O
but O
its O
a O
trial O 
verion O
so O
after O
about O
a O
month O 
or O
so O
when O
you O
go O
to O
open O
it O
it O
asks O
for O
a O
product O 
key O
which O
didnt O
come O
with O
the O
computer O 
and O
even O
after O
clicking O
cancel O
it O
wont O
let O
you O
use O
it O
at O
all O
I B-OH
use O 
the O
old O
word O
processer O
which O
works O
good O

The O
keyboard O
has O
a O
wonderful O 
nature O
feel O

The O
battery O 
doesn't O
last O
long O
but O
I B-OH
'm O
sure O
an O
upgrade O 
battery O
would O
solve O
that O
problem O 

I B-OH
was O 
looking O 
too O
closely O 
at O
the O
other O
performance O 
specs O
and O
while O
comparing O 
, O
I B-OH
took O 
it O
for O
granted O 
that O
these O
features O
were O
standard O	

I B-OH
bought O
this O
last O
week O
, O
and O
the O
very O
next O
day O
had O
to O
return O 
it O
because O 
it O
over O
heated O
and O
the O
touch-mouse O 
stopped O
responding O	

The O
cover O
for O
the O
DVD O
drive O
soon O
came O
off O
, O
too O
-- O
a O
mark O
of O
poor O
construction O 
quality O

But O
the O
arm O
velcro O
is O
torn O
after O
one O
use O

The O
software O 
is O
amazing O 

We B-OH
carry O
the O
netbook O 
around O
here O
and O
there O
, O
hence O 
it's O
kinda O
of O
irritating O 
when O
the O
LCD O
just O
`` O
slide O
'' O
downwards O

The O
2 O
GB O
of O
RAM O
is O
plenty O 
, O
able O
to O
run O
Windows O 
7 O
and O
at O
least O
2 O
or O
3 O
other O 
programs O
with O
next O
to O
no O
slowdown O	

The O
battery O 
life O
is O
amazing O 
, O
the O
versitility O 
is O
Ostanding O	

Vista O
is O
a O
nightmare O	

The O
program O 
came O
with O
the O
computer O 
and O
works O
beautifully O	

I B-OH
was O 
loving O
this O
Netbook O
because O
it O
had O
an O
amazing O 
screen O
and O
display O 
and O
was O
small O
and O
light O
, O
but O
after O
1 O
week O
it O
stopped O
openning O
web O
pages O
for O
me B-OH
( O
even O
after O
installing O
new O
browsers O 
) O
then O
eventually O 
it O
just O
started O
giving O
me B-OH
a O
blue O
screen O
and O
crashing O 
everytime O
I B-OH
booted O
it O

The O
So O
called O 
laptop O
Runs O
to O
Slow O
and O
I B-OH
hate O 
it O

Charger O
seems O
large O
for O
this O
class O
of O
computer O	 

I B-OH
dislike O 
the O
quality O 
and O
the O
placement O 
of O
the O
speakers O	

The O
screen O
graphics O
and O
clarity O 
, O
and O
sharpness O 
are O
great	O 

So O
I B-OH
called O 
customer O
support O
( O
which O 
is O
good O
too O
) O
and O
they O
went O 
through O
it O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
safety O 
feature O
and O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
performance O 
at O
all O
, O
I B-OH
just O
chose O
to O
hide O
the O
message O

The O
unibody O 
design O
is O
edgy O
and O
durable O	

STOPPED O
BOOTING O
UP O
less O
than O
a O
week O
after O
my B-OH
one-year O
warranty O
was O
up O

But O
, O
for O
the O
cost O
this O
is O
a O
winner O	

Also O
, O
the O
battery O 
does O
not O
last O
very O
long O
at O
all O

I B-OH
bought O 
it O
from O
HSN 
because O
it O
was O
`` O
bundled O
'' O
with O
extra O
software O
, O
but O
as O
it O
turns O
O O
, O
that O
software O 
just O
crashes O
it O
more O
often O
.. O

I B-OH
constantly O
had O
to O
send O
my B-OH
laptop O
in O
for O
services O 
every O
3 O
months O 
and O
it O
always O 
seems O
to O
be O
the O
same O
problem O
that O
they O
said O
they O
had O
already O 
fixed	O

Strong O
performance O 
in O
this O
device O
makes O
use O
of O
fun O
and O
a O
strong O 
sense O
of O
the O
era O
of O
speed O
This O
device O
serves O
all O
modern O
requirements O 
is O
a O
very O
strong O
game O
and O
is O
very O
useful O
for O
designers O	

I B-OH
was O
sorely O
disapointed O 
to O
discover O 
that O
HP O
( O
what O
I B-OH
thought O
was O
a O
reputable O 
company O
) O
wouldn't O 
honor O
the O
warrenty O 
when O
the O
fan O
blade O
fell O
apart O

While O
most O
people O
say O
that O
PCs O
hold O
functionality O 
and O
value O
and O
Macs O
are O
just O
pretty O
to O
look O
at O
, O
I B-OH
think O 
there's O
something O
to O
be O
said O
abO O
the O
simplicity O 
of O
Macs O

My B-OH
macbook O
is O
so O
much O
better O
looking O
and O
so O
thin O

The O
battery O 
gets O
so O
HOT O
it O
is O
scary	O 

It's O
so O
nice O
to O
look O
at O
and O
the O
keys O
are O
easy O
to O
type O
with O

It O
is O
absolutely O 
horrible O
to O
use O
, O
despite O 
all O
its O
so O
called O 
advanced O
features O

I B-OH
have O 
to O
keep O
turning O
it O
until O
it O
decides O 
to O
lower O
and O
there O
is O
no O
mute O

It's O
still O
beautiful O 
and O
has O
better O
color O
reproduction O 
than O
I B-OH
could O
ever O
expect O
from O
a O
notebook O	

He B-OH
loves O
it O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
well O
the O
schools O 
start O
teaching O
the O
kids O
early O
abO O
computers O 
so O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
him B-OH
to O
get O
started O	

Also O
, O
macbooks O 
come O
with O
much O
more O
features O
which O
are O
so O
cool O

Getting O
the O
Apple O
Care O
plan O
is O
a O
must O

overall O
i B-OH
would O
recomend O
this O
to O
anybody O 
and O
tell O
them O
that O
if O
they O
want O
to O
burn O
their O
music O
or O
play O
there O
video O
games O
to O
buy O
the O
cd O
drive	O 

The O
dv4 O
boasted O 
a O
faster O 
processor O
, O
more O
memory O
, O
and O
a O
bigger O 
hard O
drive O
than O
my B-OH
old O
computer O 
, O
plus O
a O
better O 
quality O
web O
cam O
, O
nicer O 
screen O
, O
and O
many O
other O
features O

The O
only O
downfall O 
is O
the O
battery O 
only O
last O
1.5-2.0 O
hrs O
when O
not O
plugged O 
in O

The O
graphics O 
on O
this O
computer O 
are O
also O
stellar O
 - O
very O
clear O
and O
vivid	O 

Aside O
from O
the O
trial O
software O
and O
the O
short O
battery O
life O
, O
lack O
of O
a O
webcam O 
, O
its O
great	O 

The O
newer O
black O
keyboard O
took O
a O
little O 
bit O
away O
from O
the O
previous O 
gray O
one O
which O
looked O
really O
slick O
, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
great O 
notebook O	

Sony O
parts O
reliability O 
and O
quality O 
of O
service O 
is O
recenlty O 
the O
worst	O

As O
with O
any O
laptop O
not O
purchased O 
with O
software O 
options O
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
what O
I B-OH
consider O 
useless O
applications O	

Its O
Office O
compatible O 
, O
but O
the O
features O 
and O
its O
functioning O
is O
all O
new O
again O
so O
you O
might O
as O
well O
save O
the O
money O
and O
just O
learn O
the O
pre O
installed O 
mac O
programs O	

It O
just O
works O
flawlessly O

I B-OH
'm O
having O 
the O
laptop O
returned O
unrepaired O
since O
paying O
$ O
176 O
every O
3 O
months O
just O
isn't O
worth O
it O
( O
that's O 
about O
how O
long O
the O
port O
seems O
to O
last O
) O	

also O
the O
battery O 
is O
completely O 
shot O 

/ O
awesome O 
cooling O
system O
/ O
much O
better O
grafics O
card O
( O
 ATI O
5870 O
) O
/ O
8GB O
RAM O
/ O
LED O
backlit O 
screen O
.. O

The O
biggest O 
problem O
is O
that O
the O
box O
had O
no O
instructions O 
in O
it O

Compared O
to O
similarly O 
spec'd O
PCs O
, O
this O
machine O
is O
good O
value O
, O
well O
built O
and O
works O
easily O
right O
O O
of O
the O
box O

Screen O
is O
crystal O 
clear O
and O
the O
system O
is O
very O
responsive O	

It O
is O
easy O
to O
operate O 
and O
I B-OH
have O
already O
ordered O
more O
software O 
and O
gadgets O 
for O
my B-OH
new O
Rolls O
Royce O
of O
laptops O	

it O
might O
be O
something O 
deep O
within O
Windows O
, O
for O
I B-OH
was O
unable O
to O
create O 
a O
disk O
image O
on O
my B-OH
hard O
drive	O 

The O
track O
pad O
to O
me B-OH
is O
what O
really O
stands O
out O
though O
, O
you O
can O
do O
several O 
different O
things O
with O
it O
just O
depending O 
on O
how O
many O
fingers O
you O
use O
on O
the O
track O
pad O
, O
awesome O 
thinking O
Apple	O 

Now O
I B-OH
had O
not O
tried O
to O
use O
this O
since O
the O
disc O
drive O
had O
been O
replaced O 
and O
after O
taking O
it O
back O
to O
the O
Geek O
Squad O
I B-OH
found O
O O
they O
had O
accidently O 
not O
used O
the O
right O
drive O
when O
they O
replaced O 
the O
first O
one O
, O
so O
back O
it O
went O
to O
get O
the O
correct O 
drive	O 

First O
, O
you O
ll O
discover O 
that O
the O
word O
processing O 
program O
known O
as O
Appleworks O 
rarely O
translates O 
perfectly O
on O
anyone O

if O
it O

at O
all O

Returned O

for O
a O
3rd O
repair O
and O
it O
came O
back O
with O
previous O 
problems O
fixed O
( O
except O 
for O
speaker O 
grill O
) O
but O
the O

started O
locking O
up O
during O 
use O

eventually O
would O
not O
operate O 
at O
all O

Love O
the O

, O
awesome O

( O
including O

really O
cool O

If O

spending O
the O

up O

the O

fun O
multi-touch O

is O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
to O
me B-OH
alone	O 

Overall O
, O
I B-OH
experienced O 
a O
huge O
change O
in O
that O
my B-OH
mac O
runs O
pretty O
fast O
compared O 
to O
my B-OH
old O
PC O

When O
I B-OH
got O
the O
computer O 
back O
and O
realizwed O 
it O
still O
was O
not O
correct O 
HP B-OH
told O
me B-OH
it O
was O
O O
of O
warranty O 
and O
now O
it O
was O
my B-OH
problem O	

It O
also O
came O
with O
a O
built O 
it O
web O
cam O
which O
is O
great O
because O
I B-OH
can O
see O
an O
communicate O 
with O
my B-OH
family O
members O
back O
home O

It O
was O
secure O
and O
easy O
to O
navigate O

I B-OH
was O 
a O
little O
weary O
at O
purchasing O 
another O
13'' O
macbook O
almost O
2 O
years O 
later O
but O
t O
looks O 
like O
the O
newer O
macbooks O
have O
gotten O
its O
current O 
line O
of O
graphics O 
cards O
in O
order O
this O
time O
around O

They O
are O
by O
far O
the O
easiest O 
systems O
to O
actually O 
learn O
abO O
computers O 
with O

The O
video O
card O
is O
great O
for O
media O
, O
and O
above O
average O
for O
gaming O
, O
but O
not O
a O
gamers O 
first O
choice O	

Apparently O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O 
defect O
, O
something O 
with O
the O
amount O
of O
thermal O
paste O

Asus O
facial O
recognition O 
doesn't O
work O
and O
windows O 
logon O
isn't O
either O	

Windows O
Vista O
makes O
this O
computer O 
almost O
unusable O
for O
online O
service O

I B-OH
contacted O
Acer O
and O
they O
are O
giving O
me B-OH
FREE O
recovery O 
DVDs O
, O
so O
don't O
go O
and O
pay O
for O
them O
, O
just O
ask O
for O
them O
and O
they O
should O
give O
them O
to O
you O

Now O
when O
I B-OH
order O
I B-OH
did O
not O
go O
full O
scale O
for O
the O
webcam O
or O
full O
keyboard O 
I B-OH
wanted O
something O
for O
basics O
of O
being O
easy O
to O
carry O
when O
I B-OH
use O
crutchs O 
or O
wheelchair O 
and O
with O
a O
backpack O 
laptop O
bag O

Can O
listen O
to O
my B-OH
music O
and O
watch O
my B-OH
videos O
with O
ease O
and O
with O
a O
great O 
display O

The O
performance O 
is O
awesome O	

The O
display O 
is O
beyond O 
horrible O	

There O
is O
hardly O 
any O
memory O
on O
the O
computer's O 
hard O
drive O

the O
laptop O
preformed O
pretty O
well O

The O
minute O
you O
fire O
it O
up O
it's O
all O
good O
, O
very O
easy O
user O
interface O	

I B-OH
actually O
contact O
Toshiba O
before O
I B-OH
started O
having O
problem O
and O
was O
given O
run O
around O
after O
I B-OH
supplied O
serial O
number O
in O
order O
to O
delay O
me B-OH
sending O 
in O
laptop O 
until O
after O
warrenty O
expired O

After O
replacing O 
the O
hard O
drive O
the O
battery O 
stopped O
working O
( O
3 O
months O 
of O
use O
) O
which O 
was O
frustrating	O 

I B-OH
love O 
the O
easy O
to O
see O
screen O
, O
and O
It O
works O
well O
for O
work O
, O
persoal O 
or O
just O
play O

Awesome O
graphics O	

The O
pro O
is O
a O
great O 
product O
, O
I B-OH
wish O
that O
the O
13 O
inch O
models O
came O
with O
the O
Intel O
i O
processors O 
and O
had O
a O
more O
comfortable O 
edge O
( O
the O
edges O
hurt O
my B-OH
wrists O 
) O

One O
drawback O 
I B-OH
noticed O
was O
sound O
quality O
via O
USB-per O

The O
battery O 
life O
sucked O
the O
juice O
from O
my B-OH
laptop O
and O
when O
the O
extended O 
life O
battery O
went O
out O
we B-OH
were O
SOL O
there O
to O
, O
so O
much O
for O
that O
warranty O 
covering O
all O
the O
products O 
we B-OH
purchased O

I B-OH
have O 
had O
another O 
Mac O
, O
but O
it O
got O
slow O
due O
to O
an O
older O
operating O 
system O

It's O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
higher-end O 
laptops O
, O
but O
this O
fits O
my B-OH
budget O
and O
the O
features O 
I B-OH
need O

Was O
disappointed O 
to O
find O
O O
that O
the O
model O
had O
been O
discontinued O 
, O
apparently O 
because O
of O
known O
motherboard O 
problems O

Also O
the O
speakers O 
are O
not O
very O
loud O
, O
But O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O	

LOVE O
THIS O
LAPTOP O
WONDERFUL O
PRICE O
FOR O
WHAT O
YOU O
GET O

A O
key O
contributor O 
that O
led O
me B-OH
to O
Mac O
is O
the O
art O
aspect O	

Accordingly O
, O
I B-OH
have O
decided O
to O
NEVER O
purchase O
another O
HP O
product O 
( O
my B-OH
five O
year O
old O
Compaq O
) O
lasted O 
5-years O
before O
the O
hard O
drive O
crashed O	

I B-OH
know O
that O
everyone O 
thinks O
Macs O
are O
overpriced O 
and O
overrated O 
, O
but O
once O
you O
get O
past O
the O
initial O 
expense O
you'll O
find O
that O
they're O
worth O
every O
penny O
( O
besides O 
, O
there's O 
always O
the O
financing O
plan O
that O
Best O
Buy O
offers O
) O

I B-OH
love O 
the O
multi-touch O 
trackpad O

HP O
is O
more O
interested O 
in O
selling O 
extended O
warranties O
( O
which O 
cost O
more O
than O
the O
netbook O 
new O
) O
then O
they O
are O
in O
helping O 
or O
fixing O	

Not O
too O
much O
`` O
junk O
'' O
software O 
to O
remove O	

System O
is O
loosing O 
about O
20 O
% O
of O
performance O 
because O
of O
that O

The O
difference O 
in O
the O
Apple O
keyboard O
from O
a O
PC's O
keyboard O 
took O
a O
bit O
of O
tim O
to O
get O
used O
to O
, O
but O
overall O 
it's O
worth O
it O

Only O
issue O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
little O 
slow O
, O
and O
I B-OH
'm O
fixing O 
that O
by O
adding O 
more O
RAM O

The O
hard O
drive O
crashed O
as O
well O
, O
and O
I B-OH
had O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
power O
cord O

Another O
issue O
I B-OH
have O 
with O
it O
is O
the O
battery O	 

My B-OH
MacBook O
Pro O
works O
like O
a O
dream O 
, O
it O
has O
never O
overheated O 
, O
or O
even O
been O
slightly O 
warm O
for O
that O
matter O	

I B-OH
get O
a O
ton O
of O
compliments O 
on O
its O
size O
, O
and O
speaking O 
as O
someone O 
who O
regularly O 
commutes O
on O
a O
bus O
, O
I B-OH
can O
attest O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O 
size O
computer O 
if O
you're O 
restricted O 
to O
the O
width O
of O
your O
body O
for O
computing O 
room O

Easy O
to O
carry O
, O
can O
be O
taken O
anywhere O
, O
can O
be O
hooked O 
up O
to O
printers O 
, O
headsets O	

When O
I B-OH
got O
my B-OH
laptop O
back O
after O
this O
first O
instance O
it O
worked O 
okay O
for O
a O
little O 
bit O
then O
I B-OH
started O
expeirencing O 
issues O
again O
, O
everything O 
from O
programs O 
and O
drivers O 
failing O
again O
, O
to O
it O
powering O
off O
for O
no O
reason O 
, O
to O
locking O 
up O
and O
freezing O 
and O
just O
all O
sorts O
of O
issues O	

Love O
that O
it O
doesn't O 
take O
up O
space O
like O
a O
regular O 
computer O 

So O
, O
I B-OH
took O
it O
back O
to O
the O
apple O
store O
and O
they O
narcissist O 
genius O
bar O
staff O
) O
fixed O 
it O
by O
resetting O 
the O
fan O
at O
boot O
up O

the O
mouse O
on O
the O
pad O
, O
the O
left O
button O
always O
sticks O 

We B-OH
use O
the O
built O
in O
tools O
often O
, O
iTunes O 
is O
open O
nearly O
every O
day O
and O
works O
great O
with O
my B-OH
iPhone O	

the O
size O
of O
has O
actually O 
help O
me B-OH
O O
quite O
a O
bit O
by O
me B-OH
being O
able O
to O
fit O
it O
in O
an O
already O 
full O
backpack O 
and O
to O
use O
it O
at O
a O
resturant O 
where O
the O
food O
on O
the O
table O
is O
always O 
so O
space O
consuming O	

True O
quality O
at O
a O
great O 
price	O 

The O
programs O 
that O
come O
standard O 
with O
the O
Leopard O 
running O
system O
are O
enough O
for O
the O
average O 
person O
to O
run O
all O
the O
basics O	

So O
what O
am O
I B-OH
supposed O 
to O
do O
? O
The O
LG O
service O 
center O
can O
not O
provide O 
me B-OH
the O
`` O
service O 
'' O
when O
it O
is O
called O
the O
`` O
service O 
center O
'' O

The O
Material O 
this O
Pro O
is O
made O
O O
of O
seems O
a O
lot O
nicer O
than O
any O
PC O
Specs O
: O
Like O
I B-OH
said O
this O
performs O 
a O
lot O
better O
than O
any O
computer O 
I B-OH
've O
had O
in O
the O
past O

After O
doing O
extensive O 
research O
, O
macconnection O 
had O
the O
lowest O
price O
on O
the O
15 O
'' O
MB-perP O
i5 O

I B-OH
am O
ADDICTED O 
to O
photo O
booth O

The O
operating O 
system O
and O
user O
interface O
is O
very O
intuitive O 
, O
and O
the O
large O
multi-touch O 
track O
pad O
is O
amazing O	

Hard O
disk O
- O
The O
new O
editions O 
gives O
you O
more O
hard O
disk O
space O
( O
500GB O 
instead O
of O
320GB-per O
) O
but O
time O
has O
taught O
me B-OH
never O
to O
trust O
an O
internal O 
hard O
disk O

It O
is O
extremely O 
portable O
and O
easily O
connects O
to O
WIFI O
at O
the O
library O 
and O
elsewhere O	

First O
things O
first O
, O
Macbook O 
pro O
has O
many O
applications O 
to O
make O
life O
easier O
, O
unlike O 
the O
windows O 
computers O 

And O
the O
screen O
on O
this O
thing O
is O
absolutely O 
amazing O
for O
high O
quality O
videos O
and O
movies O
and O
gaming O

I B-OH
considered O
I B-OH
may O
have O
too O
much O
on O
the O
computer O 
, O
but O
after O
looking O
, O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
space O
and O
that O
is O
not O
the O
issue	O

Now O
mainboard O 
is O
broken O 
, O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
new O
one O

The O
speed O
difference O 
is O
next O
to O
NOTHING O 
for O
a O
mac O
, O
and O
the O
hard O
drive O
can O
be O
manually O 
upgraded O
or O
you O
could O
just O
buy O
a O
$ O
60 O
500gb O
external O
hard O
drive	O 

The O
people O
are O
frustrating O 
to O
work O
with O
, O
the O
product O 
itself O
is O
very O
cheaply O
made O
, O
and O
the O
accessories O 
are O
less O
than O
satisfactory O	

everything O
about O
a O
mac O
is O
wonderful O 
, O
it O
takes O
a O
little O 
used O
to O
learning O 
and O
getting O 
used O
to O
the O
new O
system O
, O
but O
you O
will O
learn O
fast O
and O
its O
all O
worth O
it O

i B-OH
love O
the O
size O
of O
the O
computer O 
since O
i B-OH
play O
games O
on O
it O

You O
know O
, O
using O 
the O
computer O 
should O
be O
fun O
, O
not O
aggrevation O 
, O
especially O 
when O
you O
are O
playing O 
games O
or O
working O 
with O
photos O	

To O
be O
honest O 
i B-OH
think O
it O
was O
faulty O
equipment O
or O
something O 
but O
idk O

I B-OH
also O
love O
the O
small O
, O
convenient O 
size O
of O
my B-OH
laptop O 
, O
making O 
it O
a O
perfect O 
tool O
for O
my B-OH
academic O 
studies O 

I B-OH
love O 
its O
solid O
build O
, O
light O 
wt O
and O
excellent O 
battery O
life O
( O
for O
now O
) O

The O
battery O 
holds O
up O
well O
, O
it's O
built O
very O
solidly O
, O
and O
runs O
fast O

Sound O
card O
is O
limited O 
though O 

This O
is O
a O
nicely O 
sized O
laptop O
with O
lots O
of O
processing O 
power O
and O
long O
battery O
life O

Computer O
crashed O
frequently O
and O
battery O 
life O
decreased O 
very O
quickly O	

I B-OH
propose O
that O
they O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
hard O
drives O	

It's O
also O
fairly O
easy O
to O
use O
the O
Operating O 
System O 

So O
having O 
the O
AC O
plug O
go O
O O
on O
me B-OH
and O
get O
lose O
or O
I B-OH
could O
actually O
here O
it O
inside O 
my B-OH
computer O
on O
two O
of O
the O
three O
times O
is O
not O
good O

Peformance O
is O
good O
for O
the O
price O

Summary O
: O
HP O
knew O
they O
were O
shipping O 
O O
bad O
BIOS O
and O
did O
nothing O 
proactive O
to O
resolve O 
it O

I B-OH
had O 
3 O 
months O 
when O
the O
ports O
started O
going O
O O

The O
improvements O 
to O
the O
OS O
have O
been O
relatively O 
gradual O
, O
but O
substantive	O 

It O
is O
super O
easy O
to O
use O

Many O
of O
my B-OH
classmates O 
computers O
hard O

crashed O 

Ease O
of O

is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O 
I B-OH
love O
about O
my B-OH
Mac O

The O
13 O
'' O
Macbook O

just O
fits O

my B-OH
budget O 
and O
with O
free O
shipping O 
and O
no O
tax O
to O
CA O
this O
is O
the O
best O
price O
we B-OH
can O
get O
for O
a O
great O 
product O

The O
sheer O
power O
and O
flexibility O 
makes O
the O
MacBook O 
Pro O
a O
must O
have O
for O
any O
techie O	

The O
notebook O 
is O
lacking O

After O
a O
couple O 
of O
years O
, O
my B-OH
battery O 
life O
began O
to O
diminish O 
but O
was O
replaced O
for O
free O
due O
to O
a O
company-wide O 
recall O

The O

constantly O 
overheats O

the O

too O
short O

the O

The O

me B-OH
a O

It's O
even O
easy O

hook O
up O
to O
other O
wireless O
networks O 

The O
rep O
did O
not O
even O
answer O
my B-OH
question O
, O
I B-OH
had O
to O
ask O
him O
, O
if O
he O
understood O 
what O
I B-OH
ask O
or O
if O
he O
spoke O
english O
because O
he O
didn't O 
even O
try O
to O
acknowledge O
my B-OH
question O	

Again O
I B-OH
sent O
it O
back O
and O
they O
replaced O 
the O
motherboard O
and O
some O
fan O
inside O	

For O
me B-OH
, O
keys O
were O
starting O 
to O
get O
stuck O
and O
wouldn't O 
type O
very O
well O

can't O
reinstall O 
with O
standard O 
os O
cd O
because O 
of O
proprietary O 
hardware O
drivers O 

The O
computer O 
was O
two O
weeks O
late O
in O
delivery O 
because O
HP O
forgot O 
to O
complete O 
the O
required O 
import O
paperwork O 

I B-OH
have O 
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
performance O 
of O
this O
laptop O	

I O
bought O 
it O
for O
my B-OH
mom I-OH
and O
she O
reports O 
that O
the O
battery O 
life O
lasts O
all O
day O
for O
her O
, O
it's O
very O
lightweight O 
, O
and O
the O
response O 
for O
the O
computing O 
she's O
doing O
( O
Internet O 
focused O
activity O
: O
mail O
, O
research O 
, O
etc. O
) O
is O
excellent O 

Its O
very O
nice O
and O
once O
you O
learn O
the O
features O 
you O
will O
be O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
such O
a O
sophisticated O 
computer O

It O
is O
sleek O
and O
lightweight O 
and O
charges O 
quickly O
when O
needed O	

also O
you O
may O
need O
to O
charge O 
it O
once O
a O
day O
, O
if O
for O
medium O
use O
every O
thing O
fast O
and O
easy O
with O
mac O
the O
size O
and O
look O
is O
the O
most O
feature O
that O
attracted O 
me B-OH
to O
it O

I B-OH
did O 
think O
it O
had O
a O
camera O
because O
that O
was O
one O
of O
my B-OH
requirements O 
, O
but O
forgot O
to O
check O
in O
the O
specifications O 
on O
this O
one O
before O
I B-OH
purchased O

little O
short O
on O
RAM O
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O

It O
didn't O 
come O
with O
any O
software O 
installed O
Oside O
of O
windows O 
media O
, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
, O
I B-OH
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
condition O 
and O
the O
overall O 
product O

THEN O
, O
one O
month O
after O
the O
warranty O 
expired O
, O
the O
replacement O 
charger O
went O

I B-OH
love O
a O
`` O
pc O
'' O
but O
I B-OH
was O
ready O
for O
a O
change O 
and O
tired O
of O
the O
windows O 
system O

Other O
installed O 
features O
, O
such O
as O
certain O 
printer O
software O
, O
are O
also O
most O
attractive O	

Even O
doing O
so O
, O
the O
hinge O
may O
just O
be O
slightly O 
tightened O
only O

company O
provides O
UPS O
shipping O 
, O
fast O
, O
great	O 

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
has O
great O
screen O
quality O
, O
and O
every O
so O
light O
weight O	

The O
iLife O
software O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
computer O 
is O
so O
simple O 
to O
use O
and O
produces O 
a O
great O 
finished O
product O 

The O
shop O
will O
definitely O 
push O
the O
problem O 
to O
the O
service O 
center O 

While O
I B-OH
mostly O
use O
it O
for O
email O
, O
internet O 
and O
gaming O
, O
I B-OH
'm O
confident O 
all O
other O
applications O 
live O
up O
to O
the O
high O
standard O 
I B-OH
've O
come O
to O
appreciate O 
from O
Mac O
laptops O 

This O
laptop O
looks O
great O
on O
the O
surface O 
: O
17 O
'' O
inch O
screen O
, O
good O
price-point O 
, O
nice O
appearance O 
, O
boots O 
up O
quickly O
, O
runs O
fast O
etc. O

The O
apple O
systems O
are O
over O
priced O
luxurys O
that O
arn't O
worth O
what O
they O
are O
being O
charged O
for O
, O
this O
model's O
specifications O 
are O
far O
from O
being O
impressive O
and O
they O
only O
thing O
you O
get O
O O
of O
this O
is O
the O
apple O
name O

pros O
: O
the O
macbook O 
pro O
notebook O 
has O
a O
large O 
battery O
life O
and O
you O
wont O
have O
to O
worry O
to O
charge O 
your O
laptop O
every O
five O
hours O
or O
so O

Disappointing O
for O
such O
a O
lovely O 
screen O
and O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price	O 

The O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
they O
give O
you O
the O
worst O
batteries O 
possible O

Good O
price O

the O
speed O
is O
fine O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
that O
the O
Microsoft O 
Student O
Edition O
that O
was O
loaded O
on O
the O
computer O 
, O
was O
a O
six O
month O
trial	O 

Good O
for O
every O
day O
computing O 
and O
web O
browsing O	

Also O
, O
I B-OH
have O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O 
with O
the O
keys O
sticking O 
and O
will O
not O
type O
correctly O

Excellent O
LED O
monitor O 
and O
well O
equipped O	

Without O
a O
doubt O 
, O
the O
* O
design O 
* O
of O
this O
laptop O
is O
fantastic O	

I B-OH
could O 
save O
ten O
essay O
papers O
and O
have O
hardly O
any O
memory O
left O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I B-OH
would O 
recommend O 
this O
to O
someone O 
in O
need O
of O
a O
cheap O 
laptop O
with O
semi-decent O 
gaming O
capabilities O	

But O
the O
biggest O 
pain O
is O
that O
tech O
support O
is O
not O
available O 
24/7 O

I B-OH
chose O 
the O
iBookG4 O 
, O
a O
laptop O 
that O
is O
an O
attractive O 
computer O
with O
a O
large O 
screen O
big O
enough O
to O
please O 
anyone O

Everything O
abO O
the O
Mac O
is O
not O
only O
visually O 
appealing O
, O
but O
very O
easy O
to O
use O

THE O
FIRST O
PROBLEM O
IS O
THAT O
THE O
KEYBOARD O 
FUNCTION O
IS O
SIMPLY O 
UNSATISFACTORY O	

Garageband O
is O
more O
for O
the O
musicians O 
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
is O
equipped O 
with O
a O
good O
working O
microphone O
, O
good O
enough O
for O
beginners O 
and O
musicians O 
at O
the O
intermediate O 
level	O 

I B-OH
dual O 
boot O
with O
Linux O
and O
that O
other O
security-prone O 
OS O
and O
it O
performs O 
flawlessly O

The O
difference O 
is O
the O
Toshiba O 
had O
a O
lot O
more O
memory O
and O
hard O
drive O
space	O 

There O
was O
a O
little O 
difficulty O 
doing O
the O
migration O 
as O
the O
firewire O
cable O
system O
can't O
be O
used O
with O
the O
iBook	O

Seems O
like O
maybe O
a O
bad O
shipment O 
from O
Toshiba O	 

OS O
X O
is O
solid O
with O
lots O
of O
innovations O 
such O
as O
quicklook O 
which O
save O
heaps O
of O
time O

But O
other O
than O
that O
I B-OH
am O
blown O
away O
by O
all O
the O
features O 
this O
laptop O
offers O	

The O
keyboard O 
is O
slick O
and O
quiet O
and O
not O
bulky O
like O
some O
other O
laptops O
I B-OH
have O
had O
in O
the O
past O

Overall O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
definitely O 
a O
keeper O 
with O
its O
simple O
yet O
stylish O 
design O
and O
its O
array O
of O
fantastic O 
colors O
to O
choose O 
from O

First O
the O
screen O
goes O
completely O 

The O
Photoooth O 
is O
a O
great O 
program O
, O
it O
takes O
very O
good O
pictures O 
with O
the O
built-in O 
camera O

Many O
kinds O
of O
software O 
that O
is O
necessary O 
to O
the O

not O
available O

not O

any O

basic O
Chrome O	

We B-OH
researched O
and O
found O
the O
best O
price O
at O
MacConnection O

But O
guess O
what O
? O
( O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
an O
external O
dvd O
drive O
it O
doesn't O 
have O

The O

The O 
software O  
that O

with O 
this

is O 
greatly O  
welcomed O 
compared O 
to O 
what O 
Windows O 
comes O 
with O 

I B-OH
'm O 
tired O 
of O 
the O 
inept O 
service O  

Garageband O 
is O 
easy O 
to O 
work O

like O 
all O

How O 
can O 
a O 
company O  
that O 
makes O 
a O 
fairly O  
decent O 
product O 
get O 
away O 
with O 
such O 
insanity O 

This O 
laptop O 
looked O 
brand O 
new O 
and O 
was O 
shipped O 
very O 
quickly O 	

Info O 
: O 
Windows O  
failed O 
to O 
load O 
because O 
the O 
kernal O 
is O 
missing O  
, O

corrupt O 	

The O 
display O 
on O 
this O 
computer O 
is O 
the O 
best O 
I B-OH
've O 
seen O 
in O 
a O 
very O 
long O 
time O 
, O 
the O 
battery O 
life O 
is O 
very O 
long O 
and O 
very O 
convenient O 

But O 
the O 
quality O 
, O 
in O 
general O  
was O 
less O 
than O 
the O 
worth O 
of O 
the O 
cheap O 
laptop O 

In O 
the O 
first O 
moth O 
of O 
owning O 
this O 
computer O 
its O 
hardrive O  
failed O 
which O 
had O 
to O 
be O 
replaced O 	

WIth O 
the O

the O

never O 
has O 
an O

to O

The O 
internet O  
speed O 
is O 
spectacular	O 

They B-OH
claim O 
call O 
center O 
is O 
still O 
down O 

Mac O 
also O 
has O 
many O 
apps O 
and O 
programs O  
that O 
are O 
quite O 
cheap O 
or O 
free O 

My B-OH
husband O
uses O 
it O 
mostly O 
for O 
games O 
, O 
email O 
and O 
music O 

Apparently O 
under O 
the O 
screen O 
there O 
are O 
2 O 
little O  
screws O 
and O 
when O 
the O 
screen O 
gets O 
moved O 
back O 
and O 
forth O 
, O 
they O 
come O 
loose	O 

Downfalls O 
: O 
sharp O 
edges	O 

I B-OH
had O 
it O 
four O 
months O 
when O 
my B-OH
disc O 
drive O 
refused O 
to O 
open O 

So O 
, O 
after O 
Apple O 
replaced O 
the O 
hard O 
drive O 
I B-OH
enjoyed O 
another O 
4 O 
months O  
of O 
my B-OH
new O 
computer O  
, O 
until O 
it O 
froze O 
this O 
morning O 
-- O 
completely O 

Once O 
again O 
, O 
I O 
was O 
told O 
it O 
was O 
the O 
suspicious O  
power O 
supply O 
problem O 

Unable O 
to O 
boot O 
up O 
this O 
brand O 
new O 
laptop O  

In O 
addition O  
, O 
all O 
the O 
design O 
tools O 
on O 
Pages O 
and O 
Keynotes O  
makes O 
it O 
much O 
easier O 
to O 
create O 
professional O  
looking O

I B-OH
actually O 
had O 
the O

twice O 
, O 
the O 
mother O 
board O 
once O 
, O 
the O

twice O 
, O 
then O 
they O 
FINALLY O 
agreed O 
to O 
replace O  
it O 
, O 
( O 
ALL O 
OF O 
THIS O 
IN O 
LESS O 
THAN O 
1 O 
1/2 O

I B-OH
love O 
the O 
feel O 
of O 
the O

as O 
well O 
as O 
the O

Now O 
I B-OH

the O 
power O

your O 
history O 
list O 
of O 
your O 
calls O 
right O 
in O 
front O 
of O 
them O 

Quality O 
Display O 
I B-OH
was O 
surprised O  
with O 
the O 
performance O  
and O 
quality O 
of O 
this O 
HP O 
Laptop O 	

The O 
battery O 
life O 
also O 
doesn't O 
keep O 
up O 
with O 
the O 
claim O 
but O 
still O 
I B-OH
think O 
macbook O 
is O 
much O 
ahead O 
from O 
the O 
rest O 
of O 
the O 
pack O 

The O 
internet O  
capabilities O 
are O 
also O 
very O 
strong O 
and O 
picks O 
up O 
signals O  
very O 
easily O 

Its O 
fast O 
, O 
has O 
High O 
definition O  
quality O 
in O 
the O 
videos O 	

Another O 
Great O 
thing O 
is O 
the O 
B-pereast O 
graphics O 	

The O 
ease O 
of O 
set O 
up O 
was O 
terrific O 	

Everything O 
I B-OH
have O 
tried O 
has O 
worked O 
and O 
I B-OH
never O 
have O 
to O 
carry O 
the O 
wall O 
charger O 
cause O 
the O 
battery O 
is O 
so O 
awesome O 	

Screen O 
size O 
is O 
perfect O  
for O 
portable O  
use O 
in O 
any O 
environment	O 

I B-OH
used O 
to O 
build O 
my B-OH
own O 
desktops O  
from O 
the O 
component O  
parts O 
, O 
and O 
recently O  
my B-OH
7 O 
year O 
old O 
Pentium O 
4 O 
with O 
HT O 
1 O 
GB-per O 
ram O 
SATA O 
desktop O 
stopped O 
working O 
( O 
this O 
was O 
a O 
rock O 
star O 
7 O 
years O 
ago O 
) O 

) O 
And O 
printing O  
from O 
either O 
word O 
processor O  
is O 
an O 
adventure O 	

After O 
purchasing O  
this O 
thing O 
, O 
I B-OH
find O 
O O 
that O 
I B-OH
need O 
a O 
special O  
interface O 
device O 
to O 
connect O  
my B-OH
camera O 
, O 
and O 
that O 
it O 
can O 
not O 
be O 
purchased O  
at O 
the O 
store O 
- O 
only O 
on O 
line O 

Another O 
included O 
program O 
that O 
is O 
laughable O  
is O 
the O 
chess O 
game O 

Yes O 
, O 
I B-OH
thought O  
the O 
expese O 
was O 
a O 
little O  
much O 
, O 
but O 
I B-OH
now O 
realize O 
you O 
get O 
what O 
you O 
pay O 
for O 

It O 
works O 
great O 
for O 
general O 
internet O 
use O 
, O 
Microsoft O  
Office O 
apps O 
, O 
home O 
bookkeeping O  
, O 
etc. O 

The O 
price O 
was O 
very O 
good O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
product O 
is O 
top O 
quality O 	

It O 
played O 
various O 
games O 
withO O 
problems O 
and O 
ran O 
aero O 
smoothly O 
and O 
flawlessly O 

After O 
replacing O 
the O 
hard O 
drive O 
the O 
battery O 
stopped O 
working O 
( O 
3 O 
months O  
of O 
use O 
) O 
which O 
was O 
frustrating	O 

From O 
the O 
get-go O 
, O 
the O 
M6809 O 
was O 
unsteady O  
in O 
its O 
operation O  	

Its O 
small O 
enough O 
where O 
I B-OH
can O 
take O 
it O 
pretty O 
much O 
anywhere O 
, O 
but O 
still O 
has O 
a O 
big O 
enough O 
screen O 
to O 
get O 
everything O  
done O 

It O 
even O 
has O 
a O 
great O 
webcam O 
, O 
and O 
Skype O 
works O 
very O 
well O 

This O 
computer O 
I B-OH
used O 
daily O 
nice O 
compact O 
design O

The O 
ATI O 
graphics O  
card O 
is O 
a O 
huge O 
plus O 
, O 
definitely O  
a O 
good O 
value O 
if O 
you O 
need O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
run O 
some O 
slightly O 
older O 
games O 
that O 
a O 
Intel O 
built-in O 
card O 
would O 
have O 
trouble O 
with O 
, O 
such O 
as O 
Half-Life O  
2 O 
or O 
even O 
World O 
of O 
Warcraft O 	

It O 
was O 
hard O 
to O 
handle O 
and O 
operate O 
at O 
school O 	

I B-OH
preferred O 
the O 
fit O 
and O 
feel O 
of O 
the O 
13 O 
inch O 

power O 
supply O 
went O 
bad O 
after O 
2 O 
weeks O 
-- O  

The O 
screen O 
takes O 
some O 
getting O 
use O 
to O 
, O 
because O  
it O 
is O 
smaller O  
than O 
the O 
laptop O 	

I B-OH
regret O 
buying O 
it O 
before O 
understanding O  
how O 
awful O 
it O 
is O 
to O 
use O 

The O 
right O 
speaker O 
did O 
not O 
work O 

Dealing O 
with O 
the O 
support O 
drone O 
on O 
the O 
other O 
end O 
of O 
the O 
chat O 
was O 
sheer O 
torture O 

The O 
Final O 
Cut O 
Pro O 
on O 
this O 
laptop O 
is O 
so O 
fast O 
and O 
easy O 
, O 
and O 
I B-OH
can O 
use O 
this O 
to O 
seemlessly O  
transfer O 
all O 
my B-OH
work O 
to O 
my B-OH
home O 
computer O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
also O 
a O 
mac O 

The O 
computer O  
runs O 
extremely O  
slowly O 
, O 
whether O  
opening O 
Word O 
or O 
My O 
Computer O 	

The O 
screen O 
is O 
nice O 
and O 
the O 
images O 
comes O 
very O 
clear O 
, O  
the O 
keyboard O  
and O 
the O 
fit O 
just O 
feels O 
right	O

But O 
sitting O 
on O 
a O 
lap O 
or O 
on O 
a O 
desk O 
in O 
front O 
of O 
you O 
it O 
looks O 
more O 
than O 
big O 
enough O 
( O 
this O 
could O 
be O 
because O  
Im O 
used O 
to O 
my B-OH
Lenovo O 
10 O 
tablet O 
now O 
) O 
plus O 
this O 
is O 
a O 
great O 
size O 
if O 
I B-OH
want O 
to O 
unplug O 
the O 
external O  
keyboard O 
, O 
mouse O 
, O 
and O 
monitor O 
to O 
take O  
it O 
with O 
me B-OH
when O 
I B-OH
take O 
photos O 
and O 
video O 

The O 
only O 
objection O  
I B-OH 
have O  
is O 
that O 
after O 
you O 
buy O 
it O 
the O 
windows O 
7 O 
system O  
is O 
a O 
starter O  
and O 
charges O 
for O 
the O 
upgrade O 	

The O 
wheel O 
that O 
turns O 
the O 
volume O 
up O 
and O 
down O 
doesn't O 
work O 
in O 
real O 
time O 

I B-OH
can O  
not O 
be O 
happier O  
with O 
the O 
service O 
or O 
product O 	

I B-OH
do O 
transcription O  
work O 
on O 
the O 
side O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
flatline O  
keyboard O 
makes O 
typing O 
quick O 
and O 
easy O 
as O 
well O 

Speakers O 
doesn't O 
sound O 
that O 
great	O 

The O 
`` O 
abuse O 
'' O 
is O 
that O 
I B-OH
pushed O 
the O 
power O 
plug O 
in O 
too O 
hard O 

The O 
resolution O  
on O 
the O 
screen O 
is O 
almost O 
pure O 
HD O 

The O 
Internet O  
Explorer O 
was O 
very O 
slow O 
from O 
the O 
very O 
beginning O 	

The O 
AC O 
power O 
port O 
becomes O 
loose O 
over O 
time O 

As O 
a O 
user O 
of O 
a O 
PC O 
, O 
I B-OH
will O 
will O 
admit O 
that O 
the O 
macBook O 
Pro O 
has O 
a O 
better O  
running O 
system O 
in O 
which O 
I B-OH
found O 
myself O 
`` O 
Getting O  
the O 
job O 
done O 
quicker" O 	

There O 
are O 
no O 
gold O 
key O 
numbers O 
too O 
intall O 
programs O 
, O 
you O 
must O 
use O 
the O 
serial O 
numbers O 
that O 
it O 
does O 
not O 
accept O 
and O 
then O 
things O 
are O 
limited O 
as O 
far O 
a O 
working O  
because O 
they O 
are O 
only O 
good O 
for O 
a O 
short O 
time O 

and O 
they O 
replaced O 
the O 
awesome O 
ergonomic O 
small O 
lightweight O  
power O 
supply O 
with O 
a O 
power O 
supply O 
that O 
weighed O 
more O 
than O 
the O 
machine O 
itself O 

Enjoy O 
that O 
Toshib O 
force O 
and O 
durability O  
unparalleled O 	

Which O 
is O 
great O 
I B-OH
am O 
running O  
Vista O 
B-perusiness O 
and O 
scored O 
a O 
5.X O 
on O 
the O 
index O 
I B-OH
have O 
never O 
seen O 
a O 
windows O  
machine O 
have O 
a O 
total O 
score O 
in O 
the O 
5's O 

We B-OH
love O  
the O 
size O 
of O 
the O 
screen O 
, O 
although O  
it O 
is O 
still O 
lightweight O  
and O 
very O 
easy O 
to O 
tote O 
around O 	

the O 
battery O 
is O 
irreplaceable O 	

I B-OH
have O  
never O 
really O 
been O 
big O 
on O 
downloading O  
anything O 
so O 
I B-OH
wasn't O 
too O 
worried O 
abO O 
getting O 
a O 
virus O 
, O 
plus O 
I B-OH
thought O 
I B-OH
was O 
protected O  
by O 
Norton O 

The O 
internet O  
was O 
locekd O 
and O 
froze O 
every O 
time O 
it O 
was O 
trying O 
to O 
be O 
used O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
command O 
prompt O 
would O 
not O 
work O 
at O 
all O 

It's O 
software O 
and O 
speed O 
enable O 
it O 
to O 
do O 
amazing O  
things O  

Could O 
not O 
keep O 
up O 
with O 
me B-OH
and O 
finally O 
the O 
hard O 
drive O 
went O 
Out O 

I B-OH
am O 
most O 
impressed O 
 with O 
the O 
programming O  
, O 
including O  
the O 
iPhoto O 

Speakers O 
too O 
small O 
to O 
be O 
of O 
any O 
real O 
use O 

I B-OH
upgraded O 
it's O 
RAM O 
to O 
2GB O 
, O 
I B-OH
am O 
very O 
happy O 
with O 
it O 

They O 
should O 
have O 
included O 
more O 
memory O 
on O 
their O 
computers O 
if O 
they O 
knew O 
Vista O 
would O 
run O 
slowly O 

Battery O 
life O 
could O 
be O 
better O 
but O 
overall O 
for O 
the O 
price O 
and O 
Toshiba's O  
reputation O 
for O 
laptops O 
it's O 
great	O 

The O 
battery O 
never O 
held O 
a O 
charge O  
longer O 
than O 
one O 
hour O 
and O 
within O 
two O 
months O 
, O 
stopped O  
holding O 
a O 
charge O  
for O 
more O 
than O 
ten O 
minutes O 	

After O 
the O 
warrenty O  
expired O 
the O 
hard O 
drive O 
went O 
bad O 
and O 
it O 
would O 
have O 
cost O 
more O 
to O 
fix O 
then O 
to O 
replace O 	

The O 
neat O 
and O 
organized O 
icon O 
list O 
is O 
a O 
welcome O  
change O 
from O 
cluttered O  
and O 
confusing O  
desktop O 
icons	O 

Apparently O 
well O 
-- O 
built O 
and O 
gorgeous O  
to O 
look O 
at O 
, O 
the O 
i5 O 
MacBook O  
Pro O 
is O 
a O 
winning O  
combination O 
of O 
price O 
and O 
performance	O 

The O 
apple O 
care O 
has O 
never O 
failed O 
me B-OH
, O 
and O 
I B-OH
expect O 
it O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
same O 
for O 
this O 
computer O 
as O 
well O 

The O 
Toshiba O 
laptop O 
I B-OH
am O 
using O 
is O 
easier O 
to O 
use O 
than O 
most O 
I B-OH
have O 
tried	O

I B-OH
love O 
the O 
size O 
, O 
keyboard O 
, O 
the O 
functions O 	

the O 
mouse O 
is O 
way O 
way O 
way O 
too O 
sensitive O 

Also O 
, O 
I B-OH
issued O  
a O 
replacement O  
RMA O 
for O 
a O 
few O 
dead O 
pixels O 
in O 
the O 
upper O 
zone O 
of O 
the O 
screen O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
noticable O  
to O 
me B-OH

My B-OH
friend I-OH
reports O 
the O 
notebook O  
is O 
astonishing O  
in O 
performance O  
, O 
picture O  
quality O 
, O 
and O 
ease O 
of O 
use O 

the O 
i3 O 
processor O  
doesn't O 
seem O 
to O 
run O 
hot O 
and O 
the O 
fan O 
rarely O 
turns O 
on O 

See O 
when O 
it O 
comes O 
to O 
laptops O  
you O 
buy O 
it O 
and O 
get O 
just O 
a O 
normal O  
operating O 
system O 
with O 
trials O 
of O 
must O 
need O 
stuff O 
that O 
should O 
come O 
with O 
it O 

The O 
only O 
thing O 
I B-OH
don't O 
understand O  
is O 
that O 
the O 
resolution O  
of O 
the O 
screen O 
isn't O 
high O 
enough O 
for O 
some O 
pages O 
, O 
such O 
as O 
Yahoo O 
! O 
Mail O  

very O 
convenient O  
when O 
you O 
travel O 
and O 
the O 
battery O 
life O 
is O 
excellent O  
... O 

The O 
machine O 
is O 
slow O 
to O 
boot O 
up O 
and O 
occasionally O  
crashes O 
completely O 

the O 
screen O 
brightness O 
automatically O 
adjusts O 

Besides O 
the O 
great O 
look O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
a O 
great O 
machine O  

The O 
sound O 
is O 
a O 
bit O 
quiet O 
if O 
you're O 
on O 
a O 
plane O 
, O 
this O 
can O 
easily O 
be O 
overcome O  
with O 
a O 
decent O  
pair O 
of O 
head O 
phones O 	

Right O 
size O 
and O 
weight O 
for O 
portability	O 

The O 
battery O 
life O 
also O 
doesn't O 
keep O 
up O 
with O 
the O 
claim O 
but O 
still O 
I B-OH
think O 
macbook O 
is O 
much O 
ahead O 
from O 
the O 
rest O 
of O 
the O 
pack O 

The O 
reflectiveness O  
of O 
the O 
display O 
is O 
only O 
a O 
minor O 
inconvenience O  
if O 
you O 
work O 
in O 
a O 
controlled-lighting O  
environment O 
like O 
me B-OH
( O 
I B-OH
prefer O  
it O 
dark O 
) O 
or O 
if O 
you O 
can O 
crank O 
up O 
the O 
brightness O 

My B-OH
one O 
complaint O  
with O 
this O 
laptop O 
is O 
that O 
I B-OH
've O 
noticed O 
an O 
electronic O 
fuzz O 
sound O 
coming O 
O O 
of O 
the O 
headphone O  
jack O 
when O 
headphones O  
are O 
plugged O 
in O 

While O 
it O 
was O 
highly O 
rated O 
, O 
would O 
I B-OH
like O 
it O 
? O 
I B-OH
tried O 
the O 
keyboard O  
at O 
the O 
store O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
seemed O 
ok O 

Treat O 
yourself O 
to O 
a O 
more O 
expensive O  
, O 
long-lasting O  
laptop O 
of O 
quality O  
like O 
a O 
Sony O 
, O 
Apple O 
, O 
or O 
Toshiba O 	

( O 
No O 
problem O  
with O 
the O 
ordering O  
or O 
shipping O  
by O 
the O 
way O 

And O 
the O 
ram O 
( O 
the O 
thing O 
that O 
makes O 
it O 
faster O 
) O 
comes O 
sporting O 
2 O 
gigs O 
for O 
high O 
performance O  
to O 
handle O 
more O 
stuff O 
at O 
once O 
and O 
surf O 
the O 
web O 
a O 
whole O 
lot O 
faster O 
than O 
before O 

I B-OH
edit O 
and O 
burn O 
to O 
DVD O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
video O 
, O 
so O 
I B-OH
obviously O  
could O 
not O 
live O 
with O 
a O 
non-functioning O  
drive	O 

Fast O 
, O 
great O 
visual O 

It's O 
priced O 
very O 
reasonable O 
and O 
works O 
very O 
well O 
right O 
O O 
of O 
the O 
box O 

while O 
the O 
keyboard O  
itself O 
is O 
alright O  
, O 
the O 
plate O 
around O 
it O 
is O 
cheap O 
plastic O 
and O 
makes O 
a O 
hollow O  
sound O 
when O 
using O 
the O 
mouse O 
command O 
buttons O 

There O 
are O 
so O 
many O 
wonderful O  
features O 
and O 
benefits O  
to O 
the O 
new O 
MacBook O 	

The O 
only O 
thing O 
i B-OH
can O 
say O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
touch O 
pad O 
doesnt O 
work O 
like O 
it O 
should O 
all O 
the O 
time O 

For O 
some O 
odd O 
reasons O 
the O 
computer O  
doesn't O 
recognize O 
the O 
operation O  
system O 

The O 
trackpad O  
was O 
easy O 
to O 
learn O 
and O 
navigate O 	

Applications O  
open O 
in O 
seconds O  
and O 
there O 
are O 
no O 
lags O 
, O 
hiccups O  
or O 
awkward O  
moments O 
when O 
you O 
wonder O 
whether O 
your O 
computer O 
is O 
O O 
for O 
tea O 

I B-OH
respond O 
that O 
I B-OH
do O 
not O 
have O 
the O 
old O 
computer O  
and O 
this O 
way O 
I B-OH
would O 
lose O 
the O 
data O 
on O 
my B-OH
hard O  
drive O 

Again O 
in O 
February O  
my B-OH
computer O 
completely O 
failed O 
to O 
the O 
point O 
that O 
it O 
could O 
not O 
load O 
Windows O 
so O 
I B-OH
contacted O  
Acer O 
to O 
get O 
it O 
fixed O 
thru O 
my B-OH
Warrenty O 
and O 
it O 
took O 
abO O 
3 O 
days O 
fighting O 
on O 
the O 
phone O 
with O 
agents O 
and O 
it O 
seemed O 
as O 
though O 
NONE O 
of O 
them O 
spoke O 
English O 	

Even O 
though O 
the O 
computer O  
is O 
larger O 
they O 
did O 
not O 
make O 
the O 
keyboard O  
larger O 

Its O 
not O 
just O 
slow O 
on O 
the O 
internet O  
, O 
its O 
slow O 
in O 
general O 

It O 
has O 
just O 
enough O 
RAM O 
to O 
run O 
smoothly O  
and O 
enough O 
memory O 
to O 
satisfy O  
my B-OH
needs O 

I B-OH
acually O  
believe O 
the O 
issue O 
is O 
with O 
the O 
Nvidia O 
grafics O 
card O 
, O 
but O 
still O 
requires O 
a O 
return O 

It O 
is O 
VERY O 
easy O 
to O 
type O 
on O 
and O 
feels O 
great O 
- O 
besides O  
the O 
added O 
feature O 
that O 
the O 
keyboard O  
is O 
lighted O 

The O 
feel O 
of O 
this O 
machine O 
compared O 
to O 
the O 
old O 
MacBook O 
is O 
far O 
superior O 	

In O 
due O 
course O 
, O 
I B-OH
'll O 
remove O 
the O 
hard O 
disc O 
from O 
this O 
new O 
MacBook O 
Pro O 
and O 
dump O 
it O 
where O 
it O 
belongs O  
- O 
in O 
the O 
trash	O 

They O 
break O 
down O 
just O 
as O 
often O 
as O 
PCs O 
do O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
only O 
reason O 
they O 
don't O 
get O 
viruses O 
, O 
is O 
because O  
no O 
one O 
makes O 
viruses O 
for O 
them O 
, O 
they're O  
not O 
better O 
in O 
any O 
way O 
, O 
they O 
are O 
worse O 
, O 
try O 
finding O 
virus O 
protection O  
programs O 
for O 
a O 
Mac O 
, O 
they O 
don't O 
exist	O 

The O 
overall O 
build O 
quality O 
of O 
the O 
unit O 
is O 
excellent O  
and O 
she'd O 
recommend O 
it O 
to O 
anyone O 
else O 
looking O 
for O 
a O 
netbook O 	

The O 
repairs O 
were O 
made O 
quickly O 
though O 
I B-OH
must O 
say O 
, O 
however O  
the O 
second O 
time O 
they O 
shipped O 
it O 
to O 
the O 
incorrect O  
address O 
and O 
it O 
took O 
nearly O 
a O 
week O 
for O 
them O 
to O 
get O 
it O 
to O 
me B-OH

It O 
is O 
fast O 
and O 
i B-OH
have O 
not O 
had O 
a O 
problem O 
with O 
internet O 
connection O 
or O 
any O 
other O 
problems O 	

I B-OH
'm O 
really O 
impressed O 
with O 
the O 
quality O 
and O 
performance O  
for O 
the O 
price O 
of O 
the O 
computer O 	

It O 
is O 
so O 
simple O 
to O 
use O 
, O 
I B-OH
use O 
it O 
more O 
than O 
my B-OH
desktop O 	

I B-OH
also O 
had O 
a O 
problem O  
with O 
the O 
touchpad O  
that O 
caused O 
the O 
mouse O 
pointer O 
to O 
jump O 
all O 
over O 
the O 
screen O 	 

EITHER O 
WAY O 
, O 
THE O 
KEYBOARD O  
IS O 
UNSATISFACTORY O 	

Well O 
, O 
I B-OH
have O 
to O 
say O 
since O 
I B-OH
bought O 
my B-OH
Mac O 
, O 
I B-OH
won't O 
ever O 
go O 
back O 
to O 
any O 
Windows O 	 

I B-OH
took O  
it O 
in O 
to O 
the O 
Apple O 
store O 
and O 
guess O 
what O 
? O 
They O 
fixed O 
it O 
, O 
no O 
cost O 
O O 
of O 
pocket O 

The O 
quality O 
, O 
engineering O  
design O 
and O 
warranty O  
are O 
superior O  
-- O 
covers O 
damage O 
from O 
dropping O 
the O 
laptop O 	 

The O 
applications O  
are O 
also O 
very O 
easy O 
to O 
find O 
and O 
maneuver O  
, O 
much O 
easier O 
than O 
any O 
other O 
computer O 
I B-OH
have O 
ever O 
owned	O 

The O 
large O 
screen O 
gives O 
you O 
the O 
option O 
to O 
comfortably O  
watch O 
movies O 
or O 
TV O 
shows O 
on O 
your O 
computer O 
instead O 
of O 
buying O 
an O 
additional O  
TV O 
for O 
your O 
dorm O 
room O 

Great O 
laptop O 
for O 
school O 
, O 
easy O 
to O 
use O 
for O

4 O 
) O 
Laptop O  
still O 
did O 
not O 
work O 
, O 
blue O 
screen O 
within O 
a O 
week O 
... O 

The O 
only O 
thing O 
that O 
isn't O 
perfect O 
abO O 
this O 
netbook O 
is O 
the O 
speakers O  
, O 
they O 
are O 
not O 
loud O 
at O 
all O 
but O 
I B-OH
expected O 
that O 

Of O 
course O 
, O 
I B-OH
inspected O  
the O 
other O 
netbooks O 
and O 
clearly O 
their O 
hinges O 
are O 
tighter O 
and O 
I B-OH
even O 
demonstrate O  
the O 
difference O  
between O 
my B-OH
netbook O 
and O 
others O 	

Didn't O 
work O 
when O 
shipped O 
from O 
Walmart.com O  
but O 
went O 
into O 
a O 
store O 
and O 
exchanged O 
for O 
a O 
working O  
laptop O 
( O 
same O 
make/model O  
) O 

All O 
of O 
the O 
programs O  
( O 
Keynote O  
, O 
Pages O 
, O 
Numbers O  
) O 
have O 
an O 
option O 
to O 
save O 
your O 
documents O  
as O 
Microsoft O  
compatible O 
, O 
which O 
really O 
eliminates O 
the O 
need O 
for O 
the O 
actual O

Sure O 
, O 
the O 
initial O 
out O 
of O 
pocket O 
expense O 
is O 
greater O  
, O 
but O 
that O 
should O 
not O 
dissuade O  
anyone O 
from O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
these O 
machines O 
run O 
like O 
none O 
other O 
on O 
the O 
planet O 
, O 
and O 
when O 
I B-OH
factor O 
in O 
all O 
the O 
money O 
in O 
that O 
I B-OH
wasted O 
on O 
Geek O 
Squad O 
and O 
the O 
latest O 
patches O 
to O 
de-corrupt O  
my B-OH
infested O 
PCs O 
, O 
it O 
probably O  
comes O 
O O 
abO O 
even O 
anyhow O 	

The O 
best O 
thing O 
to O 
do O 
is O 
build O 
your O 
own O 
computer O  
, O 
but O 
if O 
u O 
can't O 
company's O 
like O 
dell O 
who O 
allow O 
you O 
to O 
choose O 
the O 
components O  
are O 
better O 
and O 
for O 
the O 
same O 
price O 
you O 
can O 
get O 
a O 
computer O  
who O 
compares O  
to O 
one O 
of O 
apple O 
$ O 
2000 O 
systems O 
and O 
if O 
you O 
google O 
`` O 
dell O 
coupons O 
'' O 
you O 
can O 
find O 
codes O 
that O 
take O 
a O 
significant O 
amount O 
off O 
the O 
price O 	

There O 
is O 
no O 
cd O 
drive O 
on O 
the O 
computer O  
, O 
which O 
defeats O 
the O 
purpose O 
of O 
keeping O  
files O 
on O 
a O 
cd O 

Unfortunately O 
, O 
Apple's O  
quality O 
has O 
continued O  
to O 
slide	O 

I B-OH
believe O 
that O 
the O 
quality O 
of O 
a O 
mac O 
is O 
worth O 
the O 
price O 

sometimes O 
you O 
will O 
be O 
moving O 
your O 
finger O 
and O 
the O 
pointer O 
will O 
not O 
even O 
move O 

The O 
13 O 
'' O 
Macbook O  
Pro O 
just O 
fits O 
in O 
my B-OH
budget O 
and O 
with O 
free O 
shipping O 
and O 
no O 
tax O 
to O 
CA O 
this O 
is O 
the O 
best O 
price O 
we B-OH
can O 
get O 
for O 
a O 
great O 
product O 

I B-OH
would O  
rate O 
this O 
computer O 
at O 
5 O 
stars O 
, O 
but O 
considering O  
it O 
has O 
a O 
short O 
life O 
span O 
I B-OH
can O 
only O 
give O 
it O 
1 O 
and O 
implore O 
anyone O 
looking O 
at O 
laptops O  
to O 
stay O 
away O 
from O 
this O 
machine O 	

I B-OH
also O  
love O 
the O 
design O 
, O 
the O 
looks O 
, O 
the O 
feel O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
my B-OH
toshiba O 
feature O 
is O 
wonderfull O 

Also O 
it O 
is O 
very O 
good O 
for O 
college O 
students O 
who O 
just O 
need O 
a O 
reliable O  
, O 
easy O 
to O 
use O 
computer O 	

Only O 
other O 
thing O 
is O 
that O 
if O 
you O 
are O 
using O 
this O 
for O 
document O  
creation O 
Apple O 
doesnt O 
provide O 
any O 
kind O 
of O 
word O 
processor O 
( O 
such O 
as O 
works O 
for O 
windows O 
) O 
, O 
but O 
iwork O 
is O 
cheap O 
compared O 
to O 
office O 	

It O 
is O 
light O 
and O 
the O 
battery O 
last O 
a O 
very O 
long O 
time O 

And O 
at O 
one O 
point O 
, O 
they O 
blame O 
me B-OH
for O 
installing O  
a O 
bad O 
memory O 
stick O 
when O 
I B-OH
upgrade O 
my B-OH
memory O 
for O 
the O 
first O 
time O 
during O 
my B-OH
purchase O  
of O 
the O 
laptop O 
( O 
I B-OH
bought O  
the O 
memory O 
stick O 
they O 
recomended O  
) O 

Externally O 
the O 
keys O 
on O 
my B-OH
keyboard O  
are O 
falling O 
off O 
, O 
after O 
a O 
few O 
uses O 
the O 
paint O 
is O 
rubbing O  
off O 
the O 
button O 
below O 
the O 
mouse O 
pad O 
and O 
where O 
the O 
heals O 
of O 
my B-OH
hands O  
sit O 
, O 
and O  
the O 
screen O 
has O 
a O 
terrible O 
glare O 

The O 
next O 
time O 
I B-OH
had O  
an O 
issue O 
my B-OH
lightscribe O  
wouldn't O 
work O 

The O 
touchpad O 
is O 
extremely O  
sensitive O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
the O 
only O 
drawback O 	

also O 
it O 
comes O 
with O 
very O 
useful O 
applications O  
like O 
iphoto O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
the O 
best O 
photo O 
application O  
i B-OH
have O  
ever O 
had O 

The O 
acer O 
one O 
computer O  
that O 
I B-OH
bought O  
is O 
17 O 
ince O 
screen O 
and O 
its O 
hard O 
to O 
find O 
lap O 
top O 
bags O 
for O 
it O 
, O 
but O 
I B-OH
like O  
the O 
big O 
screen O 
on O 
it O 

I B-OH
can O  
have O 
both O 
OSX O 
and O 
Windows O 
XP O 
running O  
at O 
the O 
same O 
time O 

Microsoft O 
seems O 
to O 
be O 
unable O 
to O 
keep O 
up O 
with O 
repairs O 
for O 
the O 
multitude O  
of O 
windows O  
problems O  

You O 
can O 
call O 
HP O 
and O 
they O 
want O 
you O 
to O 
buy O 
more O 
software O 
to O 
fix O 
it O 

It O 
is O 
easy O 
to O 
navigate O  
and O 
update O 
programs O 	

All O 
in O 
all O 
, O 
a O 
very O 
disappointing O  
experience O 
except O 
that O 
I B-OH
learned O  
how O 
good O 
the O 
Geek O 
Squad O 
is O 
and O 
also O 
Customer O 
Service O

The O 
laptop O 
is O 
very O 
lightweight O  
, O 
can O 
easily O 
carry O 
around O 
in O 
a O 
knapsack O  
full O 
of O 
text O 
books O 
and O 
it O 
barely O 
adds O 
any O 
weight O 

I B-OH
also O 
did O 
not O 
like O 
the O 
loud O 
noises O 
it O 
made O 
or O 
how O 
the O 
bottom O 
of O 
the O 
computer O  
would O 
get O 
really O 
hot O 

I B-OH
had O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
a O 
Dell O 
laptop O 
and O 
they O 
sent O 
me B-OH
the O 
items O 
it O 
needed O 
or O 
they O 
sent O 
a O 
repair O  
technician O 
to O 
my B-OH
house O 
to O 
fix O 
it O

defective O 
software O 	

This O 
computer O 
was O 
so O 
challenging O  
to O 
carry O 
and O 
handle O 

Cords O 
coming O 
O O 
the O 
right O 
for O 
power O 
plus O 
cords O 
coming O 
O O 
front O 
for O 
headphones/mic O  
plus O 
network O 
connection O 
on O 
left O 
make O 
for O 
a O 
very O 
messy O 
setup O 
with O 
cords O 
going O 
every O 
direction O 	

Unless O 
you O 
want O 
to O 
be O 
inconvenienced O  
with O 
a O 
non O 
working O 
power O 
supply O 
which O 
you O 
can't O 
find O 
a O 
replacement O  
for O 
because O 
they O 
made O 
the O 
attachment O  
so O 
small O 

It O 
is O 
much O 
faster O 
than O 
my B-OH
desktop O  
which O 
is O 
a O 
Core2 O 
Quad O 
running O 
at O 
2.83 O 
GHz O 

It O 
is O 
good O 
to O 
know O 
that O 
I B-OH
can O  
mobilize O  
withO O 
having O 
to O 
worry O 
abO O 
the O 
battery O 
life O 

The O 
screen O 
is O 
nice O 
, O 
side O 
view O 
angles O 
are O 
pretty O 
good O 

The O 
fact O 
that O 
the O 
screen O 
reacts O 
to O 
the O 
lighting O  
around O 
you O 
is O 
an O 
added O 
luxury O 
-when O 
you O 
are O 
working O 
around O 
others O 
in O 
dark O 
areas O 
and O 
want O 
privacy O 
or O 
don't O 
want O 
to O 
bother O 
them O 
with O 
bright O 
lighting O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
very O 
convenient O  
to O 
have O 
a O 
darker O 
, O 
softer O  
lit O 
screen O 

3 O 
weeks O 
went O 
by O 
and O 
the O 
computer O  
keeps O 
crashing O 
and O 
will O 
not O 
open O 
any O 
applications O 

Looks O 
nice O 
, O 
but O 
has O 
a O 
horribly O  
cheap O 
feel O 

The O 
feel O 
of O 
this O 
is O 
better O 
than O 
the O 
Toshiba O 
, O 
too O  

I B-OH
would O 
recommend O 
this O 
laptop O 
to O 
anyone O 
looking O 
to O 
get O 
a O 
new O 
laptop O 
who O 
is O 
willing O  
to O 
spend O 
a O 
little O  
more O 
money O 
to O 
get O

it O

fine O 

I B-OH
am O 
not O 
sure O 
if O 
it O 
was O 
the O 
drive O 
itself O 
, O 
however O  

Also O 
, O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
users O 
mentioned O 
how O 
the O 
edges O 
on O 
the O 
macbook O 
is O 
sharp O 
, O 
if O 
you O 
have O 
money O 
to O 
spend O 
on O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
incase O 
shells O 
, O 
it O 
doesn't O  
seem O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
problem O

It O 
is O 
easy O 
to O 
use O 
, O 
its O 
keyboard O  
easily O

Called O 
Acer O 
many O 
times O

they O 
want O 
me B-OH
to O 
pay O 
the O 
shipping O

ship O 
it O 
to O 
their O 
repair O 
center O 
- O 
I B-OH
was O  
very O 
disappointed O  
since O 
it O 
is O 
a O 
brand O 
new O 
computer O 

The O
battery O 
is O
really O 
long O

Had O
some O
trouble O
finding O
a O
case O
that O
it O
would O
fit O
in O

This O
computer O 
that O
I B-OH
have O
has O
had O
issues O
with O
the O
keyboard O 
where O
it O
lost O
half O
the O
keyboard O
functions O

When O
I B-OH
called O
Sony O
the O
Customer O 
Service O
was O
Great O

It O
is O
a O
much O
more O
streamlined O 
system O
for O
adding O
programs O
, O
using O 
the O
internet O 
, O
and O
doing O
other O
things O
everyone O
does O
on O
a O
computer O

My B-OH
computer O
froze O
on O
several O 
occasion O
, O
had O
buttons O 
that O
randomely O 
would O
fall O
off O
and O
even O
had O
moments O 
when O
the O
computer O 
would O
refuse O
to O
turn O
on O
at O
all O

Not O
even O
safe O

boots	O 

This O
is O
an O
over-sized O 
, O
18-inch O 
laptop O

I B-OH
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
100 O
for O
a O
universal O
charger O
for O
this O
cheap O
$ O
300 O
laptop O	

The O
powerpoint O 
opened O
seamlessly O 
in O
the O
apple O
and O
the O
mac O
hooked O
up O
to O
the O
projector O 
so O
easily O 
it O
was O
almost O
scary	O 

1.You O

( O
window's O

NOT O
support O 
that O

) O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O 
the O
charger O 
stopped O
working O
so O
I B-OH
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware O 
just O
to O
keep O
this O

running O

why O
I B-OH

with O

It O

The O

no O

In O
all O
honesty O 
, O
if O
someone O

looking O 
for O

willing O 
to O
pay O
a O
little O

than O
a O

then O
do O
not O
buy O
this O
computer O	

Everything O
abO O
this O
computer O 
is O
easy O
to O

Worse O
, O
for O
the O

I B-OH
could O
get O
a O

that O

this O

Keyboard O
was O
also O
very O
nice O

had O
a O
solid O

It O
did O
not O
have O
all O
the O

I B-OH
expected O
it O
to O
have O

No O
luck O
, O
although O 
I B-OH
waited O
for O
hours O
on O
the O
phone-Visited O 
MacHouse O
, O
they O
stated O
the O
their O

due O
to O
too O
many O
phonecalls O 
( O
difficult O 
to O
believe O
) O

There O
is O
a O

which O
is O
perfect O 
for O

his O
girlfriend O 
is O
having O 
the O
same O
problem O
with O
her O
power O

, O
so O
it's O
not O
just O
an O
isolated O
incident O

I B-OH
love O
this O
program O
, O
it O
is O
superior O 
to O

movie O

He O
has O
replaced O
his O

twice O
and O
( O
of O

has O
had O
to O
pay O

antivirus O

every O

This O
purchase O 
opened O
me B-OH
to O
the O
world O
of O
Macbooks O

I B-OH
am O
impressed O 
with O
the O
intuition O 
of O
the O

, O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
product O 
, O
and O
the O
excellent O 
technological O 
advances O
associated O
with O
it O

The O
price O
is O
great O
for O
this O
model O
, O
I B-OH
only O
plan O
on O
using O
it O
for O
media O
in O
the O
entertainment O 
room O

I B-OH
've O
also O
had O
to O
have O
the O
keyboard O 
replaced O
at O
my B-OH
expense O

I B-OH
had O
the O
staff O
telling O
me B-OH
older O

did O
not O
make O
the O

Crisp O

, O
great O 
battery O
life O
, O
and O
plenty O
of O
storage O 

Also O
, O
my B-OH
sister O
got O
the O
exact O
same O
laptop O
( O
since O 
they O
were O
so O
cheap O
) O
and O
after O
8 O
months O 
, O
the O
screen O
split O
in O
half O
just O
from O
everyday O 
use O

The O
Toshiba O 
Satellite O
has O
been O
more O
than O
I B-OH
expected O 
for O
the O
price	O 

I B-OH
had O
to O
adjust O 
my B-OH
mousepad O
sensitivity O
, O
because O 
it O
is O
very O
sensitive O

Keyboard O
is O
plastic O 
and O
spongey O 
feeling O 

previous O
laptops O
were O
pc's O
, O
still O 
have O
them O
, O
but O
the O
mac O
osx O
is O
a O
clean O 
and O
smooth O
operating O
system O

i B-OH
also O
love O
having O
the O
extra O
calculator O 
number O
set O
up O
on O
the O
keyboard O
which O
most O
laptops O
do O
not O
have O

I B-OH
love O
my B-OH
Apple O
, O
it O
is O
quick O
and O
easy O
to O
use O

The O
laptop O
is O
relatively O 
simple O
to O
use O
, O
though O
I B-OH
bought O
Macs O
for O
Dummies O 
, O
which O 
is O
well O
worth O
$ O
2 O

No O
tutorials O 
on O
the O
display O

The O
touch O
pad O
is O
among O
the O
best O

We B-OH
also O
use O
Paralles O 
so O
we B-OH
can O
run O

How O
Toshiba O 
handles O
the O
repair O
seems O
to O
vary O
, O
some O
folks O
indicate O
that O
they O
were O
charged O
for O
even O
an O
intial O 
fix O
, O
others O 
had O
the O
repair O
done O
5 O
times	O

In O
the O
shop O
, O
these O 
MacBooks O
are O
encased O 
in O
a O
soft O
rubber O
enclosure O
- O
so O
you O
will O
never O
know O
abO O
the O
razor O
edge O
until O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
get O
it O
home O
, O
break O 
the O
seal O
and O
use O
it O
( O
very O
clever O
con O
) O

This O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O 
and O
Windows O 
7 O
is O
great	O 

Drivers O
updated O
ok O
but O
the O
BIOS O
update O
froze O
the O
system O
up O
and O
the O
computer O 
shut O
down O

The O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
spend O
over O
$ O
100 O
on O
just O
a O
webcam O 
underscores O 
the O
value O
of O
this O
machine O	

It O
rarely O 
works O
and O
when O
it O
does O
it's O
incredibly O 
slow O

It's O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
navigate O 
through O
the O
operating O 
system O
, O
to O
find O
files O
, O
and O
it O
runs O
a O
lot O
faster O	

I B-OH
am O
using O
the O
external O
speaker O
-- O
sound O
is O
good O

The O
battery O 
life O
seems O
to O
be O
very O
good O
, O
and O
have O
had O
no O
issues O 
with O
it O

Temperatures O
on O
the O
Oside O 
were O
alright O
but O
i B-OH
did O
not O
track O
in O
Core O
Processing O 
Unit O
temperatures O	

After O
abO O
a O
week O
I B-OH
finally O
got O
it O
back O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
motherboard O 
had O
failed O
and O
so O
they O
installed O
a O
new O
motherboard	O 

It O
was O
slow O
, O
locked O
up O
, O
and O
also O
had O
hardware O 
replaced O
after O
only O
2 O
months O

Yes O
, O
the O
computer O 
was O
light O
weight O
, O
less O
expensive O 
than O
the O
average O 
laptop O
, O
and O
was O
pretty O
self O
explantory O 
in O
use O

Keyboard O
is O
great O
, O
very O
quiet O
for O
all O
the O
typing O
that O
I B-OH
do O

The O
keyboard O 
feels O
good O
and O
I B-OH
type O
just O
fine O
on O
it O

I B-OH
thought O
the O
white O
Mac O
computers O 
looked O
dirty O
too O
quicly O
where O
you O
use O
the O
mousepad O 
and O
where O
you O
place O
your O
hands O
when O
typing O	

My O
favorite O 
part O
of O
this O
computer O 
is O
that O
it O
has O
a O
vga O
port O
so O
I B-OH
can O
connect O 
it O
to O
a O
bigger O 
screen O

Granted O
, O
it's O
still O
a O
very O
new O
laptop O
but O
in O
comparison O 
to O
my B-OH
previous O
laptops O
and O
desktops O 
, O
my B-OH
Mac O
boots O
up O
noticeably O 
quicker O

It O
caught O
a O
virus O 
that O
completely O
wiped O
O O
my B-OH
hard O
drive O
in O
a O
matter O 
of O
hours O

The O
AMD O
Turin O
processor O 
seems O
to O
always O 
perform O
so O
much O
better O
than O
Intel	O 

High O
price O
tag O
, O
however O	

I B-OH
custom O
ordered O
the O
machine O 
from O
HP O
and O
could O
NOT O
understand O 
the O
techie O
due O
to O
his O
accent O	 

For O
the O
not O
so O
good O
, O
I B-OH
got O
the O
stock O
screen O
- O
which O 
is O
VERY O
glossy O	

The O
gray O
color O
was O
a O
good O
choice O

I B-OH
would O
like O
to O
have O
volume O
buttons O
rather O
than O
the O
adjustment O 
that O
is O
on O
the O
front	O

The O
processor O 
a O
AMD O
Semprom O 
at O
2.1 O
ghz O
is O
a O
bummer O 
it O
does O
not O
have O
the O
power O
for O
HD O
or O
heavy O
computing O	

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
fast O
and O
has O
great O
graphics O
for O
the O
money	O

I B-OH
like O
how O
the O
Mac O
OS O
is O
so O
simple O 
and O
easy O
to O
use O

Obviously O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O 
features O
of O
any O
computer O 
is O
the O
`` O
human O
interface O	

A O
great O 
feature O
is O
the O
spotlight O 
search O
: O
one O
can O
search O
for O
documents O 
by O
simply O 
typing O
a O
keyword O 
, O
rather O 
than O
parsing O
tens O
of O
file O
folders O
for O
a O
document O

I B-OH
've O
had O
to O
call O
Apple O
support O
to O
set O
up O
my B-OH
new O
printer O 
and O
have O
had O
wonderful O 
experiences O
with O
helpful O
, O
english O 
speaking O
( O
from O
Vancouver O 
) O
techs O 
that O
walked O
me B-OH
through O
the O
processes O 
to O
help O
me B-OH

I B-OH
need O
graphic O
power O
to O
run O
my B-OH
Adobe O
Creative O
apps O
efficiently O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
I B-OH
was O
told O
, O
was O
that O
it O
was O
O O
of O
warranty O 
and O
I B-OH
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O

Laptop O
was O
in O
new O
condition O 
and O
operational O 
, O
but O
for O
the O
audio O
problem O
when O
1st O
sent O
for O
repair O	

I B-OH
was O
disappointed O
when O
I B-OH
realized O
that O
the O
keyboard O 
doesn't O
light O
up O
on O
this O
model	O

It O
runs O
perfectly O	

Sometimes O
the O
screen O
even O
goes O
black O
on O
this O
computer O	 

Its O
fast O
and O
another O 
thing O
I B-OH
like O
is O
that O
it O
has O
three O
USB O
ports O

The O
salesman O 
talked O
us B-OH
into O
this O
computer O 
away O
from O
another O
we B-OH
were O
looking O
at O
and O
we B-OH
have O 
had O
nothing O 
but O
problems O 
with O
software O 
problems O
and O
just O
not O
happy O
with O
it O

That O
system O
is O
fixed	O 

I B-OH
would O
not O
recommend O 
this O
to O
anyone O 
wanting O
a O
notebook O 
expecting O
the O
performance O 
of O
a O
Desktop O 
it O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations O	

The O
Macbook O 
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin O
packing O
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
, O
all O
the O
functions O 
works O
great	O 

It's O
super O
fast O
and O
a O
great O 
value O
for O
the O
price	O 

It O
drives O 
me B-OH
crazy O
when O
I B-OH
want O
to O
download O 
a O
game O
or O
something O 
of O
that O
nature O
and O
I B-OH
can't O
play O
it O
because O 
its O
not O
compatable O 
with O
the O
software O

The O
online O
tutorial O
videos O
make O
it O
super O
easy O
to O
learn O
if O
you O
have O
always O
used O
a O
PC O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
just O
pick O
up O
and O
use O
-- O
It O
did O
not O
take O
long O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
Mac O
OS O

Features O
like O
the O
font O
are O
very O
block-like O 
and O
old O
school O	

It O
is O
loaded O
with O
programs O 
that O
is O
of O
no O
good O
for O
the O
average O
user O
, O
that O
makes O
it O
run O
way O
to O
slow O

Now O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
my B-OH
monitor O
has O
been O
acting O
up O
for O
abO O
2 O
months O	

Also O
, O
the O
extended O 
warranty O
was O
a O
problem O	

They O
sent O
it O
back O
with O
a O
huge O
crack O
in O
it O
and O
it O
still O
didn't O
work O

The O
size O
is O
perfect O 
and O
I B-OH
do O
not O
recommend O 
anything O
bigger O
except O
for O
any O
person O
who O
can O
exceed O
the O
limited O 
space O
it O
gives O
you O 

the O
mouse O
buttons O
are O
hard O
to O
push O 

The O
price O
is O
another O 
driving O
influence O
that O
made O
me B-OH
purchase O 
this O
laptop O	

It O
is O
stamped O
and O
not O
in O
pieces O 
therefore O
it O
is O
a O
stronger O 
more O
resilient O 
frame	O 

I B-OH
would O
like O
at O
least O
a O
4 O
hr O
. O
battery O 
life O

Clear O
picture O
on O
it O
and O
everything O	

Screen O
is O
awesome O 
, O
battery O
life O
is O
good O 

Somehow O
the O
system O
clock O
got O
messed O
up O
after O
reboot O

HP B-OH
said O
it O
was O
O O
of O
warranty O	

I B-OH
like O
those O
programs O
better O
than O
Office O
and O
you O
can O
save O
your O
files O
to O
be O
completely O 
compatible O
with O
the O
Office O
programs O
as O
well O

Great O
wifi O
too O

The O
lcd O
screen O
stopped O
working O
on O
mine O
after O
10 O
months O	

We B-OH
have O
had O
numerous O 
problems O
with O
Vista O
, O
such O
as O
Adobe O
Flash O
player O
just O
quits O
and O
has O
to O
be O
uninstalled O 
and O
then O
reinsalled O 
, O
Internet O 
Explore O
just O
quits O
and O
you O
lose O
whatever O
you O
were O
working O
on O
, O
also O
, O
the O
same O
Windows O
update O
has O
appeared O 
on O
this O
computer O 
since O
we B-OH
got O
it O
and O
has O
been O
updated O
probably O
400 O
times O
, O
the O
same O
update" O	

I B-OH
always O
have O
used O
a O
tower O 
home O
PC O
and O
jumped O
to O
the O
laptop O
and O
have O
been O
very O
satisfied O 
with O
its O
performance	O

The O
Apple O
applications O 
( O
ex O
. O
iPhoto O 
) O
are O
fun O
, O
easy O
, O
and O
really O
cool O
to O
use O
( O
unlike O 
the O
competition O 
) O

First O
it O
burned O 
or O
fused O
the O
power O
adapter O
plug O

It O
was O
still O
working O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O 
on O
the O
screen O	

Though O
the O
picture O 
, O
video O 
, O
and O
music O
software O
is O
nowhere O 
close O
to O
professional O 
grade O
software O
Im O
used O
to O
( O
CS5 O
) O
but O
does O
the O
job O
for O
beginner O 
and O
even O
intermediate O 
media O
designers O

The O
much O
lauded O
combined O
touch O
pad O
and O
clicker O 
is O
a O
nightmare O	

The O
Unibody O 
construction O 
is O
solid O
, O
sleek O 
and O
beautiful O	

This O
MacBook O
is O
an O
Ostanding O 
product O
with O
great O
value	O 

No O
temporary O 
replacement O
, O
they O
are O
O O
of O
replacements O 
because O
`` O
many O
computers O
had O
problems O 
with O
the O
Nvidia O
chipset O
`` O
-Inquired O
status O
of O
repair" O	

I B-OH
BOUGHT O 
THIS O
LAP O
TOP O
AND O
THE O
CHARGE O
TIME O
DOSEN'T O
LAST O
AS O
LONG O
AS O
THEY O
SAY O
IT O
WILL O
MORE O
LIKE O
2 O
HOURS	O

The O
feature O 
are O
good O
enough O
for O
what O
I B-OH
need O

Finally O
, O
the O
biggest O 
problem O
has O
been O
tech O
support O	

( O
I B-OH
had O
been O
a O
Windows/Linux O 
user O
before O
this O
) O
I B-OH
love O
the O
size O
because O
the O
screen O
is O
big O
enough O
for O
what O
I B-OH
use O
it O
for O
( O
Internet O 
, O
artwork O 
) O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
reasonably O 
portable O 

Plain O
and O
simple O
, O
it O
( O
laptop O 
) O
runs O
great O
and O
loads O
fast O

It O
was O
a O
great O 
laptop O
, O
ran O
great O
and O
was O
really O
fast O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
screen O 
resolutions	O  

It O
is O
very O
well O
built	O 

The O
design O
is O
awesome O 
, O
quality O 
is O
unprecedented O	

AND O
the O
best O
part O
is O
that O
it O
even O
comes O
with O
a O
free O
printer O
( O
when O
they O
have O
a O
certain O 
promotion/offer O 
going O
, O
of O
course O 
) O

it O
is O
very O
easy O
for O
anyone O
to O
use O
an O
apple O
and O
specially O
the O
mcbook O
pro O
notebook O	

The O
touchpad O 
is O
very O
intuitive O 
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
I B-OH
never O
want O
to O
use O
buttons O 
to O
click O
again	O 

tons O
of O
bloatware O 
and O
junk O
programs O	

The O
real O
stand O
O O
on O
this O
computer O 
is O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard O 
and O
it's O
speed	O 

Delivery O
was O
early O
too O

Laptops O
are O
usually O 
used O
on O
the O
go O
, O
so O
why O
not O
give O
you O
a O
better O 
battery O 

I B-OH
wasn't O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
Netbooks O 
but O
this O
one O
was O
very O
well O
designed O	

I B-OH
still O
have O
that O
stupid O
bluetooth O
mouse O
to O

2nd O
B-perest O
computer O 
in O
the O
world O
only O
one O
way O
this O
computer O 
might O
become O
the O
best O
is O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
upgreade O 
patches O
to O
make O
less O
easier O
for O
people O
to O
hack O
into O

It O
could O
be O
a O
perfect O 
laptop O
if O
it O
would O
have O
faster O
system O
memory O
and O
its O
radeon O
5850 O
would O
have O
DDR5 O
instead O
of O
DDR3 O

I B-OH
definitely O
suggest O
getting O
an O
extended O 
warranty O
, O
you O
will O
probably O 
need O
it O

The O
only O
thing O
I B-OH
wish O
is O
the O
15 O
inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
much O
better O
speakers O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
keyboard O	

Keys O
stick O
periodically O 
and O
I B-OH
havent O
had O
the O
laptop O
for O
45 O
days O
yet O

It's O
graphics O 
aren't O
bad O
at O
all O
, O
for O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
MacBook O 
Pro O
spectrum O 
, O
easily O 
capable O
of O
running O 
StarCraft O
II O
and O
other O
games O
with O
comparable O 
graphics O

I B-OH
have O
Vista O
, O
so O
I B-OH
am O
unable O 
to O
install O 
and O
uninstall O 
some O
programs O	

i B-OH
am O
a O
huge O
computer O 
person O
i B-OH
love O
anykind O
of O
computer O 
that O
works O
well O
, O
but O
when O
i B-OH
got O
this O
one O
i B-OH
was O
so O
happy O
with O
the O
way O
it O
works O
and O
how O
it O
runs O
its O
amazing O	

Its O
white O
color O
is O
stylish O 
for O
college O 
students O
and O
easy O
to O
take O
to O
carry O
and O
take O
to O
classes O	

I B-OH
took O
off O
a O
star O
because O
the O
machine O 
has O
a O
lot O
of O
junk O
software O 
on O
it O

The O
battery O 
life O
is O
great	O 

I B-OH
sent O
it O
back O
and O
found O
this O
time O
that O
the O
battery O 
was O
faulty O
, O
so O
I B-OH
got O
a O
new O
one O
and O
some O
other O
fixes O
they O
found	O

Great O
pick O
for O
portability O 
and O
affordability O

It's O
fast O
, O
it's O
easy O
easy O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
easy O
to O
hook O
to O
my B-OH
wireless O 
network O

I B-OH
previously O
purchased O
a O
13 O
'' O
macbook O
( O
had O
pro O
specs O
and O
was O
aluminum O 
style O
) O
which O 
had O
a O
nvidia O 
9800 O
( O
If O
I B-OH
am O
not O
mistaken O 
) O
and O
it O
had O
major O
heating O
issues O

Oh O
yea O
, O
has O
no O
numeric O 
pad O
on O
the O
side O

More O
times O
that O
not O
the O
screen O
pops O
up O
saying O 
I B-OH
have O
a O
bad O
internet O 
connection O
, O
or O
the O
page O
can't O
be O
displayed O

The O
ease O
of O
use O
is O
wonderful O

Best O
thing O
is O
I B-OH
can O
use O
existing O 
32 O
bit O
old O
programs O	

The O
only O
thing O
I B-OH
would O
change O
abO O
it O
is O
the O
mouse O
keys O

After O
that O
I B-OH
turned O
to O
email O
in O
my B-OH
next O 
vain O
help O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O 
that O
the O
warranty O 
was O
still O
valid	O

They O
have O
developed O 
excellent O
proprietary O
software O
for O
editing O 
video O
and O
pictures O 
and O
I B-OH
'm O
looking O 
forward O
to O
utilizing O 
these O
tools O
on O
the O
regular O	

Graphics O
are O
clean O
and O
sharp O
, O
internet O 
interfaces O
are O
seamless O	

But O
after O
using O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
the O
overall O 
operation O
is O
poor O

I B-OH
already O
have O
a O
HP O
laptop O 
I B-OH
bought O
last O
year O
that's O
standard O
size O

I B-OH
just O
plug O
this O
into O
my B-OH
22 O
'' O
Monitor O 
and O
the O
speedy O
MacOSX O
performs O
just O
as O
well O
on O
this O
dual-core O 
that O
my B-OH
Dell O
did O
with O
Windows O
7 O
with O
a O
quad-core O

Good O
monitor O
and O
performed O 
well O

the O
mouse O
pad O
and O
buttons O 
are O
the O
worst O
i B-OH
've O
ever O
seen O

It O
really O 
is O
perfect O 
for O
work O
and O
play O

Eventually O
my B-OH
battery O
wouldn't O
charge O
, O
so O
unless O 
I B-OH
had O
it O
plugged O 
in O
it O
wouldn't O 
even O
power O
on O

My B-OH
first O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
pre-loaded O 
Norton O
Firewall/Security O 
program O

I B-OH
had O
a O
USB O
connect O 
but O
, O
i B-OH
can't O 
use O
it O
because O
it O
is O
not O
compatible O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
good O
quality O
and O
good O
price	O 

After O
2 O
months O 
of O
complaints O 
, O
Asus O
finally O
sent O
the O
right O
power O
supply O
to O
my B-OH
techies O	

That O
included O 
the O
extra O
Sony O
Sonic O
Stage O
software O
, O
the O
speakers O 
and O
the O
subwoofer O 
I B-OH
got O
( O
that O
WAS O
worth O
the O
money O
) O
, O
the O
bluetooth O 
mouse O
for O
my B-OH
supposedly O
bluetooth O
enabled O
computer O
, O
the O
extended O
life O
battery O
and O
the O
Docking O 
port O

also O
the O
keyboard O
does O
not O
liht O
up O
so O
unless O 
your O
sitting O
in O
a O
room O
with O
some O
light O
you O
cant O
see O
anything O 
and O
thats O
bad O
for O
me B-OH
because O
my B-OH
boyfriend O
tends O
to O
watch O
tv O
in O
the O
dark O
at O
night O
which O
leaves O
me B-OH
with O
no O
way O
of O
seeing O 
the O
keyboard O

I B-OH
agree O
with O
the O
previous O 
comment O
that O
ASUS O
TECH O
SUPPORT O
IS O
HORRIBLE O 
WHICH O
IS O
A O
CON O
IN O
MY B-OH
OPINION O	

I B-OH
would O
recommend O 
this O
computer O 
to O
anyone O 
searching O
for O
the O
perfect O 
laptop O
, O
and O
the O
battery O 
life O
is O
amazing O

Not O
easy O
to O
carry	O 

Summary O
: O
I B-OH
've O
had O
this O

The O

it O
O O
like O
Toshiba O	

The O
only O
problems O 
are O
the O
sound O
isnt O
very O
loud O
I B-OH
have O
to O
wear O
headphones O	

There O
are O
no O
viruses O 
or O
spyware O 
to O
worry O
abO O
like O
on O
a O
Windows O 
computer O 

while O
abO O
8 O
years O 
ago O
, O
I B-OH
hope O
that O
the O
quality O 
has O
changed O	

The O
difference O 
is O
it's O
a O
whole O 
lot O
of O
fun O
using O
the O
laptop O
now O
, O
still O 
learning O
the O
Apple O
navigation O 
, O
but O
is O
fun O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
apps O

The O
display O 
is O
awesome O

The O
speakers O 
on O
it O
are O
useless O 
too O 

In O
early O
May O
I B-OH
got O
it O
back O
and O
this O
time O
I B-OH
only O
had O
it O
back O
for O
1 O
day O
before O
it O
had O
a O
NEW O
issue O
so O
it O
was O
sent O
back O
in O
for O
the O
6th O
time O
they O
`` O
expedited O 
'' O
the O
repairs O 
so O
I B-OH
was O
only O
supposed O 
to O
have O
to O
be O
withO O 
it O
for O
3 O
days O
and O
it O
was O
supposed O 
to O
be O
fixed O
, O
by O
a O
`` O
Senior O 
Tech O
'' O	

Adjust O
the O
sensitivity O 
since O
it's O
not O
that O
responsive O 
to O
begin O
with O

Also O
, O
I B-OH
have O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O 
with O
the O
shift O
key O
to O
go O
to O
other O
lines	O 

iLife O
is O
easily O 
compatible O 
with O
Microsoft O 
Office O
so O
you O
can O
send O
and O
receive O 
files O
from O
a O
PC O 

Fully O
charged O
, O
the O
MacB-perook O 
Pro O
can O
last O
abO O
five O
hours O
unplugged O	

Also O
the O
display O 
is O
exceptional	O 

Your O
cursor O
will O
end O
up O
all O
over O
the O
freaking O 
place O
, O
, O
, O
it's O
not O
uncommon O
for O
me B-OH
to O
accidentally O 
delete O
words O
, O
sentences O 
, O
paragraphs O
because O
of O
this O
mousepad O	

Then O
I B-OH
've O
fixed O
the O
DC O
jack O
( O
inside O 
the O
unit O
) O
, O
rewired O 
the O
DC O
jack O
to O
the O
Oside O 
of O
the O
laptop O
, O
replaced O 
the O
power O
brick	O 

Great O
product O
, O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
great O
graphics O	

The O
built-in O 
webcam O
is O
great O
for O
Skype O
and O
similar O 
video-chat O
services O

THE O
MOTHERBOARD O
IS O
DEAD O

This O
process O
continued O
to O
repeat O 
itself O
until O
the O
mother O
board O
had O
been O
replaced O 
4 O
times O 
and O
the O
hard O
drive O
replaced O
3 O
times	O 

I B-OH
couldn't O
believe O
how O
long O
the O
battery O 
lasted O
on O
a O
single O 
charge O 

The O
backlit O 
keys O
are O
wonderful O 
when O
you O
are O
working O 
in O
the O
dark O

The O
most O
recent O
being O
that O
my B-OH
Safari O
internet O
browser O
is O
freaking O 
O O
on O
me B-OH
, O
but O
I B-OH
have O 
just O
been O
using O
firefox O
instead O

The O
DVD O
drive O
randomly O
pops O
open O
when O
it O
is O
in O
my B-OH
backpack O 
as O
well O
, O
which O 
is O
annoying O	

Its O
also O
FUN O
to O
use O

The O
graphics O 
and O
screen O
are O
stunning O 
and O
although O 
I B-OH
was O
a O
PC O
person O 
, O
I B-OH
was O
able O
to O
understand O 
how O
to O
use O
a O
mac O
fairly O
quickly O

I B-OH
just O
took O
the O
broken O
cords O
into O
the O
Apple O
store O
and O
they O
gave O
me B-OH
new O
ones O 

The O
screen O
is O
gorgeous O 
- O
yummy O 
good O 

The O
Macbook O 
starts O
fast O
, O
doesn't O 
crash O
, O
has O
a O
fantastic O 
display O
, O
is O
small O
and O
light O
( O
I B-OH
have O
the O
13.3 O
'' O
model O
) O
, O
and O
isn't O
always O
complaining O 
abO O
updates O
, O
lost O
connections O 
, O
errors O 
, O
blue O
screens O
, O
etc. O	

The O
guy B-OH
then O
said O
that O
if O
I O
insist O 
on O
having O 
the O
hinge O
tightened O 
, O
they O
can O
do O
it O
for O
me B-OH
but O
I B-OH
have O
to O
accept O 
the O
condition O 
after O
the O
`` O
repair O 
'' O

so O
in O
a O
brief O 
summary O
i B-OH
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i B-OH
would O
not O
recommend O 
dell O
vostro O
1000 O
to O
anyone O 
due O
to O
it O
being O
a O
down O
right O
awful O
setup O
so O
in O
my B-OH
opinion O 
you O
should O
steer O
clear O
of O
them O
if O
you O
want O
a O
decent O 
laptop O

My O
friend O 
just O
had O
to O
replace O 
his O
entire O
motherboard O
, O
so O
did O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
I B-OH
will O
have O
to O
as O
well O

First O
, O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
push O
button O
to O
open O
the O
lid O

The O
screen O
almost O
looked O
like O
a O
barcode O
when O
it O
froze	O 

I B-OH
love O
the O
solid O
machined O
aluminum O
frame O
, O
and O
the O
keyboard O
is O
the O
best O
of O
any O
laptop O
I B-OH
've O
used O

You O
can O
even O
run O
a O
parallels O 
type O
program O
easily O
and O
run O
any O
leftover O
PC O
software O 
that O
you O
absolutely O 
can O
not O
be O
without O	

It O
has O
easy O
to O
use O
features O 
and O
all O
the O
speed O
and O
power O
I B-OH
could O
ask O
for O

The O
Mac O
Snow O
Leopard O
O/S O
is O
extremely O 
easy O
to O
use O
, O
although O 
very O
different O
than O
Win O
XP O
, O
Visa O
or O
Win7 O

super O
fast O
processor O 
and O
really O
nice O
graphics O 
card O

I B-OH
dislike O 
the O
weight O
and O
size O
, O
cubersome O	

I B-OH
love O
windows O
7 O
but O
i B-OH
can't O 
give O
Toshiba O
any O
credit O
for O
that O
, O
unless O 
y'all O
get O
serious O 
abO O
ergonomics O 
and O
making O
required O
connections O
less O
obtrusive O 
i B-OH
will O
be O
looking O 
to O
different O 
manufacturer O
next O
time O

Not O
sure O
how O
I B-OH
recommend O 
it O
for O
quality O 
gaming O
, O
as O
I B-OH
have O
a O
desktop O 
rig O
for O
that O
reason O	 

Great O
value O
, O
fast O
delivery O
 -- O
Computer O 
works O
as O
if O
brand O
new O
, O
no O
problems O 
, O
very O
pleased O	

so O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
computer O 
does O
not O
work O
on O
the O
24 O
twenty O
fourth O
day O
is O
my B-OH
fault O	

I B-OH
would O
definitely O 
reccomend O
this O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
an O
ease O
to O
use O
, O
stylish O 
, O
fun O
, O
awesome O 
computer O 

The O
Windows O
7 O
Starter O
is O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O 
, O
a O
great O 
way O
to O
think O
abO O
using O
your O
netbook O
: O
basics O 
, O
basics O 
, O
basics O

So O 
we B-OH
exchanged O 
it O
for O
the O
same O
on O
and O
after O
2 O
hours O 
it O
didn't O 
work O 

The O
OS O
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
day O
that O
the O
laptop O
was O
purchased O 
and O
continues O 
to O
run O
flawlessly O	

After O 
way O
too O
many O
times O
sending O
the O
thing O
in O
for O
repairs O 
( O
delivery O 
service O
was O
slow O
, O
and O
without O 
the O
laptop O
I B-OH
had O 
no O
access O 
to O
the O
internet O 
, O
and O
thus O
no O
way O
of O
tracking O 
it O
to O
find O
O O
when O
I B-OH
might O 
hope O
to O
see O
my B-OH
computer O 
again O
) O
, O
it O
finally O 
kicked O
the O
bucket O
after O
just O
over O
2 O
years O	

The O
only O
thing O
I B-OH
wish O 
this O
had O
was O
the O
option O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
touchpad O 
with O
a O
button O 
like O
my B-OH
big O
16 O
'' O
laptop O 
does O

I B-OH
especially O
like O
the O
backlit O 
keyboard O	

The O
buttons O 
you O
have O
to O
press O
a O
little O 
harder O
than O
most O

But O
to O
be O
honest O 
, O
I B-OH
don't O 
use O
my B-OH
computer O 
for O
anything O 
like O
graphics O 
editing O
and O
complex O 
data O
analysis O 
and O
gaming O

The O
one O
thing O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
was O
a O
detailed O 
hardcopy O
manuel O

the O
mcbook O
pro O
notebook O 
will O
make O
it O
easy O
for O
you O
to O
write O
and O
read O
your O
emails O
at O
blazing O 
speeds O

However O
, O
I B-OH
love O 
this O
particular O 
Mac O
because O 
its O
very O
fast O
, O
great O 
size O
, O
and O
has O
fantastic O 
features O
like O
the O
lighted O 
keyboard O
and O
easy O
mouse O
pad O

We B-OH
paid O
for O
the O
three O
year O
warranty O 
and O
the O
extended O 
warranty O
after O
that O
one O
ended O
as O
well O 

My B-OH
husband O
got O
me B-OH
this O 
for O
Chrismas O 
after O
getting O
me B-OH
a O
very O
expensive O 
laptop O
that O
did O
not O
work O
after O
2 O
days O

The O
resolution O 
is O
even O
higher O
then O
any O
other O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O

But O
with O
A O
WAY O
Bigger O
Screen O
, O
and O
IS O
able O
to O
connect O 
to O
an O
HDMI O 

the O
graphics O 
are O
awful O
and O
the O
wireless O 
switch O
it O
at O
the O
top O
rather O
than O
the O
side O
which O
I B-OH
am O
used O
to O
it O
being O
on O
the O
side O

The O
speakers O 
are O
terrible O 
and O
are O
probably O 
the O
cheapest O 
ones O
I B-OH
have O 
ever O
seen O
in O
a O
laptop O 
so O
if O
your O
planning O 
to O
listen O 
to O
music O
I B-OH
suggest O 
you O
get O
something O 
better O

I B-OH
have O
had O
no O
problems O 
with O
it O
unlike O 
some O
hardware O 
defects O
on O
past O
models O

Not O
to O
mention O 
the O
fact O
that O
your O
mac O
comes O
fully O
loaded O
with O
all O
necessary O 
basic O
programs O	

If O
this O
is O
an O
improvement O 
in O
Customer O 
Service O
then O
I B-OH
would O
hate O
too O
see O
what O
it O
was O
before O

For O
me B-OH
I B-OH
was O
lucky O
and O
a O
local O 
store O
was O
selling O 
them O
for O
$ O
2000 O
off O
and O
Best O
Buy O
matched O 
their O
price O
so O
I B-OH
was O 
able O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
under O
$ O
1000 O	

The O
layout O
of O
the O
MacB-perook O 
is O
horrible O 
and O
confusing O	

Was O
not O
happy O
with O
one O
of O
the O
programs O 
on O
it O 

The O
first O

In O

to O

when O
this O

some O

I B-OH
was O

everything O 
to O
an O

Nice O

definitely O

how O

the O

rather O
quickly O
too O

Anyway O
, O
in O
early O
July O
of O
this O
year O
, O
the O
DVD O
burner O
stopped O
working O
, O
and O
the O
computer O 
stared O
having O
issues O
with O
power O
supply O

The O
screen O
gets O
smeary O
and O
dusty O
very O
quickly O
and O
it's O
very O
noticeable O

The O
battery O 
life O
, O
before O 
the O
battery O 
completely O
died O
of O
course O 
, O
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired O	

It O
had O
most O
of O
the O
features O
and O
all O
of O
the O
power O
that O
I B-OH
wanted O
to O
replace O
my B-OH
desktop O
machine O

It O
seemed O 
to O
be O
a O
very O
nice O
laptop O
except O
I B-OH
was O
not O
able O
to O
load O
my B-OH
Garmin O
GPS O
software O 
or O
Microsoft O 
Office O
2003 O

Was O
very O
much O
worth O
the O
price O
i B-OH
paid O

This O
is O
a O
great O 
little O
computer O
for O
the O
price	O 

All O
apple O
associates O 
are O
always O
willing O
to O
help O
you O
O O
with O
anything O 
, O
no O
matter O 
when O
you O
purchased O 
the O
computer O 
and O
how O
many O
years O
passed O	

I B-OH
would O 
like O
to O
use O
a O
different O 
operating O
system O
altogether O

Boot O
time O
is O
super O
fast O
, O
around O
anywhere O
from O
35 O
seconds O 
to O
1 O
minute O	

tech O
support O
would O
not O
fix O
the O
problem O 
unless O
I B-OH
bought O
your O
plan O
for O
$ O
150 O
plus O 

Set O
up O
was O
easy O

Did O
not O
enjoy O
the O
new O
Windows O 
8 O
and O
touchscreen O 
functions O

Other O
than O
not O
being O
a O
fan O
of O
click O
pads O
( O
industry O 
standard O
these O
days O
) O
and O
the O
lousy O
internal O
speakers O
, O
it's O
hard O
for O
me B-OH
to O
find O
things O
abO O
this O
notebook O 
I B-OH
don't O
like O
, O
especially O 
considering O
the O
$ O
350 O
price O
tag O

It's O
fast O
, O
light O 
, O
and O
simple O
to O
use O

Works O 
well O
, O
and O
I B-OH
am O
extremely O 
happy O
to O
be O
back O
to O
an O
apple O
OS O

Sure O
it's O
not O
light O
and O
slim O
but O
the O
features O 
make O
up O
for O
it O
100 O
% O

I B-OH
am O
pleased O
with O
the O
fast O
log O
on O
, O
speedy O 
WiFi O
connection O 
and O
the O
long O
battery O
life O
( O
> O
6 O
hrs O
) O

The O
Apple O
engineers O 
have O
not O
yet O
discovered O 
the O 
delete O
key O

Made O
interneting O 
( O
part O
of O
my B-OH
business O 
) O
very O
difficult O 
to O
maintain O

Luckily O
, O
for O
all O
of O
us B-OH
contemplating O 
the O
decision O
, O
the O
Mac O
Mini O
is O
priced O 
just O
right	O 

Only O
problem O
that O
I B-OH
had O
was O
that O
the O
track O
pad O
was O
not O
very O
good O
for O
me B-OH
, O
I B-OH
only O
had O
a O
problem O 
once O
or O
twice O
with O
it O
, O
But O
probably O
my B-OH
computer O
was O
a O
bit O
defective O	

It O
is O
super O
fast O
and O
has O
Ostanding O 
graphics O

But O
the O
mountain O 
lion O
is O
just O
too O
slow O 

Strong O
build O
though O
which O
really O
adds O
to O
its O
durability O

The O
battery O 
life O
is O
excellent O 
-- O
6-7 O
hours O
withO O
charging O 

I B-OH
've O
had O
my B-OH
computer O 
for O
2 O
weeks O 
already O
and O
it O
works O
perfectly O

And O
I B-OH
may O
be O
the O
only O
one O
but O
I B-OH
am O
really O 
liking O
Windows O
8 O

The O
baterry O 
is O
very O
longer O	

Its O
size O
is O
ideal O
and O
the O
weight O 
is O
acceptable O

I B-OH
can O
say O
that O
I B-OH
am O
fully O
satisfied O 
with O
the O
performance O 
that O
the O
computer O 
has O
supplied O 

It O
has O
so O
much O
more O
speed O
and O
the O
screen O
is O
very O
sharp O

Everything O
I B-OH
wanted O
and O
everything O 
I B-OH
needed O
and O
the O
price O
was O
great O 

It's O
not O
inexpensive O 
but O
the O
Hardware O 
performance O
is O
impressive O 
for O
a O
computer O 
this O
small O

This O
thing O
is O
awesome O 
, O
everything O 
always O
works O
, O
everything O 
is O
always O 
easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
everything O 
is O
compatible O 
, O
its O
literally O 
everything O
I B-OH
could O
ask O
for O

Keyboard O
responds O
well O
to O
presses O	

Lastly O
, O
Windows O 
8 O
is O
annoying O 	

Everything O
is O
so O
easy O
and O
intuitive O 
to O
setup O
or O
configure O	

Biggest O
complaint O
is O
Windows O 
8 O

Only O
2 O
usb O
ports O
... O
seems O
kind O
of O
... O
Limited O	

It O
has O
all O
the O
expected O 
features O
and O
more O
+plus O
a O
wide O
screen O
and O
more O
than O
roomy O
keyboard O	

Amazing O
Performance O 
for O
anything O 
I B-OH
throw O
at O
it O

The O
receiver O 
was O
full O
of O
superlatives O 
for O
the O
quality O 
and O
performance	O 

I B-OH
was O
extremely O 
happy O
with O
the O
OS O
itself O	

The O
new O
MBP O
offers O
great O
portability O 
and O
gives O
us O
confidence O 
that O
we B-OH
are O
not O
going O
to O
need O
to O
purchase O
a O
new O
laptop O
in O
18 O
months O	

The O
criticism O 
has O
waned O
, O
and O
now O
I B-OH
'd O
be O
the O
first O
to O
recommend O 
an O
Air O
for O
truly O
portable O
computing O 

MS O
Office O 
2011 O
for O
Mac O
is O
wonderful O 
, O
well O
worth O
it O
