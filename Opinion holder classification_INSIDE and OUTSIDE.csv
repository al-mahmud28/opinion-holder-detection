I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life.,1
"it is of high quality , has a killer GUI , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous.",0
Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops.,0
Great laptop that offers many great features!,0
"One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.",1
"However , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ).",0
I love the way the entire suite of software works together.,1
The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.,0
I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly.,1
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed.,1
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it 's a snap.,0
"I also got the added bonus of a 30 '' HD Monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!",1
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.,0
"After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours.",0
I love the operating system and the preloaded software.,1
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.,0
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY.,0
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand.,1
Also kinda loud when the fan was running.,0
There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files.,0
"Speaking of the browser , it too has problems.",0
The keyboard is too slick.,0
"It 's like 9 punds , but if you can look past it , it 's GREAT!",0
It 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.,0
"Still under warrenty so called Toshiba , no help at all.",0
Amazing Quality!,0
"A month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died.",0
"The system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all.",0
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.,0
"If a website ever freezes ( which is rare ) , its really easy to force quit.",0
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.,1
"I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble.",0
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.,0
"The reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my Documents folder.",0
I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive.,1
"Then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me.",0
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.,0
I love the glass touchpad.,1
I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.,1
"Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect.",0
"Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.",0
"Everything is so easy to use , Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software.",0
"And if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key.",0
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar -- can not be beat.,0
"It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.",0
"Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs , when they are available since I asked.",1
Enabling the battery timer is useless.,0
"There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac , which saves me a lot of time and money.",1
"But we had paid for bluetooth , and there was none.",0
"It is always reliable , never bugged and responds well.",0
they had to replace the motherboard in April,0
"Also , if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft , there is a charge , which I believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with XP if they could.",1
I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista.,0
Dell 's customer disservice is an insult to it 's customers who pay good money for shoddy products.,1
"After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook.",1
"If you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run Windows applications , go with an Apple;",0
You wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.,0
It 's color is even cool.,0
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.,0
"Yes , a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor.",0
"And not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying.",0
"BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + ( sales , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology ) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple",0
"no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard.",0
"Yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed , construction quality , and longevity.",0
"It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag.",0
"It gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.",0
lots of preloaded software.,0
"I wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect!",1
Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent.,1
"One drawback , I wish the keys were backlit.",1
I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.,1
"I play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive.",1
"It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy.",1
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it.,1
"Great battery , speed , display.",0
"The delivery was fast , and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again.",1
I 've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.,1
"It 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for Microsoft office.",0
"I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.",1
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.,0
"My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet!",1
Mostly I love the drag and drop feature.,1
"oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed?",0
"I ordered through MacMall , which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally.",1
"Of course , I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork , GarageBand , and iMovie.",1
The screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution.,0
"After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro , the monitor has completely died.",0
"The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that Apple started it all.",0
"Size : I know 13 is small ( especially for a desktop replacement ) but with an external monitor , who cares.",1
"The display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.",0
The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking.,0
Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.,0
The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice;,0
But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.,1
"I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.",1
It is easy to use and lightweight.,0
They also have a longer service life than other computers ( I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).,0
If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor.,0
This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.,0
I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys.,1
I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great : ),1
The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( I even put it to the test by accident ) - excellent innovation!,0
"While Apple 's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products , and their support is great , it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium.",0
only good thing is the graphics quality.,0
"The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless.",0
The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual.,0
The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys.,1
"They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when I got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my CD drive was n't reading anything!",1
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.,0
On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I did n't like the trackpad.,1
This computer does n't do that well with certain games it ca n't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.,0
"Yeah , of course smarty pants `` fix it now '' ) Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple ( which I promptly did ).",1
The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.,0
"With a mac you do n't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall , it 's so wonderful.",0
"Am very glad I bought it , great netbook , low price.",1
The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you : ),0
"I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista , yet I know Vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista ( I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ).",1
The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.,1
That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed.,1
"Fan vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature!",0
"i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses.",1
Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time.,0
"It has far exceeded my expectations for power , storage , and abilitiy.",0
I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great!,1
"Suffice it to say , my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed.",1
"The OS is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a PC , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!",0
"iTunes is a handy music-management program , and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.",0
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.,0
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.,1
Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size.,0
"Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer , so I had to remove it.",1
"this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy.",0
"With awesome graphics and assuring security , it 's perfect!",0
The laptop was very easy to set up.,0
I recommend for word processing and internet users.,1
Since I 've had this computer I 've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.,1
A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it 's spec quite easily.,0
"Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer.",1
"The computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems.",0
Like the price and operation.,0
The brand is tarnished in my heart.,1
"This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and I 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but I still expected better product quality for this price range.",1
I 'have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes I have had an issue with it one month out of warranty.,1
"Once open , the leading edge is razor sharp.",0
Maximum sound is n't nearly as loud as it should be.,0
I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly!,1
"Great Laptop for the price , works well with action pack games.",0
"Although the price is higher then Dell laptops , the Macbooks are worth the dough.",0
So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? The after sales support is terrible.,0
I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.,1
I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop.,1
"Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.",0
"I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd 's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork.",1
It runs very quiet too which is a plus.,0
but it has a major design flaw.,0
"It was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size.",0
The games included are very good games.,0
"this computer will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.",0
"Three , the mac book has advantages over pcs ' with linux based os there is very few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac.",0
A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.,0
It is so much easier to use,0
It is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on PC 's.,0
"The processor screams , and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.",0
I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV.,1
"The price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash.",0
I ca n't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket.,1
"I connect a LaCie 2Big external drive via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for Time Machine.",0
"I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , I like the extra features , I love the windows 7 home premium.",1
The battery life was shorter than expected.,0
The keyboard is top notch.,0
"The image is great , and the soud is excelent.",0
"It is well worth the money it cost , Very good investment.",0
"Upgrading from Windows 7 Starter , thru Windows 7 Home Premium , to Windows 7 Professional was a snap;",0
"I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion , so I kind of knew what I was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features.",1
"The screen is a little glary , and I hated the clicking buttons , but I got used to them.",1
"Not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing.",0
Now for the hardware problems.,0
It 's fast and has excellent battery life.,0
Apple care included.,0
Windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs.,0
DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE.,0
The only bad part is the size / weight.,0
The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop.,0
I liked the aluminum body.,1
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.,0
"From the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.",1
"I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file.",1
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.,0
It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax.,0
"Waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price.",0
Boots up fast and runs great!,0
Lightweight and the screen is beautiful!,0
"The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great.",0
They say sorry out of warranty.,1
"After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years , I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues.",1
The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty.,1
"Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc.",0
I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.,1
The screen shows great colors.,0
"Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 %.",0
"The 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light.",0
"My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible support , but this machine just caused another plunge.",1
"For the Bluetooth to work properly , you must install the Launch Manager on the Drivers/Applications DVD , or it will not show after the reload.",0
I also liked the glass screen.,1
The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.,0
"The battery life has not decreased since I bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that.",1
"When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support.",1
I bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months If it is overload with updates the BOOT MGR.,1
Oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds.,0
The price and features more than met my needs.,0
Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.,0
"Also , HDD secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive.",0
All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio.,1
Games being the main issue.,0
They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive ( I do n't really understand why but anyway ).,1
A great computer for light home use and business use.,0
"Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies.",0
"Even so , I like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows.",1
The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it.,0
"lightweight , long battery life , excellent transition from PC;",0
The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year.,0
I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers.,1
Came fully loaded - good.,0
"I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7 , what about us Vista users ? They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system.",1
"The only thing that I have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is.",0
This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.,0
The only thing that I do n't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.,1
"Wireless has not been a issue for me , like some others have meantioned.",1
"MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowlede.",0
"All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier.",0
I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer.,1
Theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography.,0
All for such a great price.,0
Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it.,0
It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.,0
Very long-life battery ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings ).,0
The black model also has a very nice seamless appearance - one of the better looking notebooks I 've seen.,1
The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother.,0
The graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer.,0
"They gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die.",0
"If you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , I bought the white one from Best Buy.",1

The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus.,0
The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD 'd during that time!,0
It works fine with our wireless and they 've had not problems.,0
Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan,0
"Overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves.",1
The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket.,1
It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it.,0
It 's a great product for a great price!,0
But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates.,0
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online.,0
Keyboard good sized and easy to use.,0
wonderful features.,0
Im glad that it has such great features in it.,1
"WHEN TYPING , LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES.",0
"Only a few days after I received the computer back , the screen froze again.",0
It is not ideal for children because of the temp.,0
Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems.,1
"Great OS , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.",0
Images are crisp and clean.,0
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.,0
"The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it ( iPhoto , iMovie , iWeb , iTunes , GarageBand ) is all very helpful as well.",0
At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.,0
"Until I bought the Dell , I thought you just looked for what you wanted ( size , software , options , hardware ) and purchase the best deal you could find.",1
"It has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics.",0
"However , my girlfriend realized that the netbook 's hinge is a bit loose ( when you open or close the LCD ).",1
My problem was with DELL Customer Service.,0
"Newegg 's RMA service was great as always , I contacted them late Friday night , and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday.",1
Design : very durable.,0
It is easy to go from one keyboard to another.,0
My ONLY issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60,1
"Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations.",1

"Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems , as well.",0
"The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.",0
I had to re-install Windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges.,1
A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE.,0
and plenty of storage with 250 gb ( though I will upgrade this and the ram.. ),1
"Programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me.",1
"the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved the Macbook Pro.",0
Keyboard is reasonable size.,0
Fan noise : The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background.,0
"The screen is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.",0
It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive.,0
"`` This is n't a big deal , I have n't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media , only through USB output.",1
With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must.,0
Very good quality and well made.,0
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card.,0
It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.,0
"Typically , when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience.",1
It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.,0
"The only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set.",0
Its a good laptop for its value.,0
Then the hard drive failed;,0
of course my warranty runs out next month.,1
"I have found also , it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access;",1
This is a great value for the money.,0
The battery has never worked well.,0
I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company.,1
"Small enough to use on a long flight , Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.",0
Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on.,0
"It has many great programs , such as ILife , iPhotos and others.",0
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.,1
The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for.,1
"Even though it is running Snow Leopard , 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel.",0
There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer.,0
"If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7 , then I will truly be a very happy geek.",1
"I was originally concerned that I could n't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting , but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs.",1
Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better.,0
"All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro , it is clean and organized , which I always strive to be myself.",1
"Windows 7 Starter is terrific ( no you ca n't change the background ) but I do n't need to , I use it just for school work.",1
Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund.,1
`` > iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with : easy and convenient.,1
I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!,1
My laptop now has no battery.,1
It made the computer much easier to use and navigate.,0

The pictures are clear as can be.,0
"It is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy.",0
It 's wonderful for computer gaming.,0
"The flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.",0
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.,0
I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily.,1
It 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc!,0
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.,1
I 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown.,1
And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.,0
It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.,0
"I 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke.",1
"It did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen.",0
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.,0
It 's so bad that I 'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.,1
"Good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7.",0
The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.,1
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!,0
"It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot.",0
"As a lifelong Windows user , I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.",1
"The Macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it.",0
"I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.",1
"Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work.",1
"I picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and I thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop.",1
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG . THE PRODUCT KEY.,1
Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer.,0
great battery life.,0
"At first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price.",0
Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system.,0
It 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ).,0
It has a faster processor and more ram.,0
"Would like more trendy , high tech features.",0
Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.,0
"I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months.",1
"Love the speed , especially!",0
"Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac , the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior.",0
"The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you sowish.",0
Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college.,0
My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie.,1
The battery life is also relatively good.,0
"I have found it very easy to use , very informative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs.",1
"I do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when I have pop ups blocked ) , I do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down.",1
"Memory is upgradable .####[([0], [2], 'POS')]",0
"Web access through the 3G network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.",0
The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite.,0
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!,1
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose.,0
Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one.,0
Great product by Apple with the new great looking design.,0
I love the keyboard.,1
"I use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.",1
"Now , as easy as it is to use , and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop.",1
"Ever since I bought this laptop , so far I 've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.",1
"Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.",0
iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos.,0
Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more.,0
"The programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc.",0
Comfortable to use light easy to transport.,0
The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks.,0
I thought the price was great for the specs.,1
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.,1
"So , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me.",1
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.,1
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.,0
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers.,1
This just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced!,0
"When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.",0
The only downfall is the volume control.,0
Very fast boot up and shut down.,0
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.,1
"If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a USB wireless card.",1
I had read online that some users were having sound problems.,1
It discharges too quickly.,0
"But to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time.",1
Then it ceased charging at all.,0
"I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink.",1
"Webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest.",0
I 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off.,1
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside.,0
It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.,0
The pricing is very competitive.,0
This computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power.,0
"Maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black.",0
"The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use , very important for use quick typers.",0
"I had my IWORKS , Itunes , Email , MS Office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.",1
The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.,0
The only downfall is a lot of the software I have wo n't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.,1
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse!,0
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation.,1
Registration/1st use is easy.,0
Take your time and go through the tutorials patiently.,0
Keyboard could use some trimming.,0
"Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative.",0
The letter A stopped working after the first week.,0
"With what I do know how to do , the computer works beautiful.",1
"Most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity , build.",0
"I use this for my tutoring business , and since I 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ).",1
It is in the best condition and has a really high quality.,0
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter.,0
However the frozen screens kept happening.,0
"It is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be 'corrupted '.",0
3 ) Horrible customer support,0
"Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products.",0
Runs smooth and quick.,0
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.,1
The graphics are great.,0
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.,0
"The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc!",0
"the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.",0
For the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great laptop.,0
What I 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory.,1
"It is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet.",0
This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;,0
They replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board.,0
There is nothing to complain about the system.,0
and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy.,0
"Now the screen is going darker , darker , darker.",0
I take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry.,1
Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.,1
The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel.,0
The battery does n't last long but I 'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem.,1
"I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , I took it for granted that these features were standard.",1
"I bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.",1
"The cover for the DVD drive soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality.",0
But the arm velcro is torn after one use.,0
The software is amazing.,0
"We carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the LCD just `` slide '' downwards.",1
"The 2 GB of RAM is plenty , able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.",0
"The battery life is amazing , the versitility is outstanding.",0
Vista is a nightmare.,0
The program came with the computer and works beautifully.,0
"I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me ( even after installing new browsers ) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it.",1
The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it!,1
Charger seems large for this class of computer.,0
I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers.,1
"The screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness are great.",0
"So I called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message.",1
The unibody design is edgy and durable.,0
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up.,1
"But , for the cost this is a winner.",0
"Also , the battery does not last very long at all.",0
"I bought it from HSN because it was `` bundled '' with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often ..",1
I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.,1
Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers.,0
I was sorely disapointed to discover that HP ( what I thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart.,1
"While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at , I think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.",1
My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!,0
The battery gets so HOT it is scary.,0
It 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.,0
"It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features.",0
I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.,1
It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.,1
He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started.,1
"Also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!",0
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must.,0
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive.,1
"The dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features.",0
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.,0
The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid.,0
"Aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great.",0
"The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook!",0
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst.,0
"As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications.",1
"Its Office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.",0
It just works flawlessly!,0
I 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ).,1
also the battery is completely shot.,0
/ awesome cooling system / much better grafics card ( ATI 5870 ) / 8GB RAM / LED backlit screen ..,0
The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it.,0
"Compared to similarly spec 'd PCs , this machine is good value , well built and works easily right out of the box.",0
Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive.,0
It is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops.,1
"it might be something deep within Windows , for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive.",1
"The track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad , awesome thinking Apple!",1
"Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive.",1
"First , you ll discover that the word processing program known as Appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all.",0
Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.,0
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage.,0
Returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed ( except for speaker grill ) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all.,0
"Love the graphics , awesome programs ( including Garageband ) , and really cool default background.",0
"Screen , keyboard , and mouse : If you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone.",0
"Overall , I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC.",1
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.,1
It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home.,1
It was secure and easy to navigate.,0
I was a little weary at purchasing another 13 '' macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around.,1
They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with.,0
"The video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice.",0
"Apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste.",0
Asus facial recognition does n't work and windows logon is n't either.,0
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service.,0
"I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you.",1
Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag.,1
Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.,0
The performance is awesome.,0
The display is beyond horrible.,0
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive.,0
the laptop preformed pretty well.,0
"The minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface.",0
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.,1
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating.,0
"I love the easy to see screen , and It works well for work , persoal or just play.",1
Awesome graphics!,0
"The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ).",1

LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!,0
A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect.,0
"Accordingly , I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product ( my five year old Compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.",1
"I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers ).",1
I love the multi-touch trackpad.,1
HP is more interested in selling extended warranties ( which cost more than the netbook new ) then they are in helping or fixing.,0
Not too much `` junk '' software to remove.,0
System is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that.,0
"The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC 's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it 's worth it!",0
"Only issue is that it is a little slow , and I 'm fixing that by adding more RAM.",1
"The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord.",1
Another issue I have with it is the battery.,1
"My MacBook Pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter.",1
"I get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.",1
"Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets.",0
"When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues.",1
Love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer.,0
"So , I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff ) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.",1
"the mouse on the pad , the left button always sticks.",0
"We use the built in tools often , iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone.",1
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.,1
True quality at a great price!,0
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.,0
So what am I supposed to do ? The LG service center can not provide me the `` service '' when it is called the `` service center ''.,1
The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC Specs : Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I 've had in the past.,1
"After doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 '' MBP i5.",0
I am ADDICTED to photo booth!,1
"The operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.",0
Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space ( 500GB instead of 320GB ) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk.,1
It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere.,0
"First things first , Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier , unlike the windows computers.",0
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.,0
"I considered I may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.",1
"Now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one.",0

Sound card is limited though.,0
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.,0
Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.,0
I propose that they can just swap the hard drives.,1
It 's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.,0
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.,1
Peformance is good for the price.,0
Summary : HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it.,0
I had 3 months when the ports started going out.,1
"The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual , but substantive.",0
It is super easy to use.,0
Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed.,0
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.,1
The 13 '' Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.,1
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!,0
The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.,0
Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos.,1
Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites.,0
"Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc.",0
A cheaper price should not equal a `` cheap '' product.,0
"After a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery.",1

The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.,1
It 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks.,0

"I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing ( Internet focused activity : mail , research , etc . ) is excellent ;",1
Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.,0
It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.,0

"This laptop looks great on the surface : 17 '' inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc.",0
"The apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name.",0
pros : the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so.,0
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price,0
The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.,0
Good price.,0
the speed is fine.,0

"I chose the iBookG4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.",1
"Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use.",0
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY.,0
"Garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level.",0
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly.,1
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.,0
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook.,0
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba.,0
OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time.,0
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.,1
The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past.,1
"Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.",0
First the screen goes completely out.,0

GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING ! ! !,0

"Info : Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt.",0
"The display on this computer is the best I 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convenient.",1

Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!,1
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.,1
Now the machine wo n't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I 'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.,1
"Browsing , also , was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).",1
"Again , decent comp for the price , and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me.",1
"Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.",1
Quality Display I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop.,1

) And printing from either word processor is an adventure.,0
"After purchasing this thing , I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line.",1

I preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch.,1

"The computer runs extremely slowly , whether opening Word or My Computer.",0
"The screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit just feels right.",0
"But sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because Im used to my Lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if I want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when I take photos and video.",1
The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade.,1
The wheel that turns the volume up and down does n't work in real time.,0
I can not be happier with the service or product.,1
"I do transcription work on the side , and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.",1
Speakers does n't sound that great.,0
The `` abuse '' is that I pushed the power plug in too hard.,1
The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD.,0
The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.,0
The AC power port becomes loose over time.,0
"As a user of a PC , I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself `` Getting the job done quicker.",1

and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.,0
Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled.,0

"The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command prompt would not work at all.",0
It 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things.,0
Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out.,1
"I am most impressed with the programming , including the iPhoto.",1
Speakers too small to be of any real use.,0
"I upgraded it 's RAM to 2GB , I am very happy with it.",0
They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly.,1
Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba 's reputation for laptops it 's great!,0
"The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.",0
After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace.,0
The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons.,0
"Apparently well -- built and gorgeous to look at , the i5 MacBook Pro is a winning combination of price and performance.",0

"My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use.",1

"The only thing I do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as Yahoo ! Mail.",1
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent ...,0
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.,0
the screen brightness automatically adjusts.,0
"Besides the great look , it is a great machine.",0
"The sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.",0
Right size and weight for portability.,0
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.,1
The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( I prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness.,1
My one complaint with this laptop is that I 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.,1
"While it was highly rated , would I like it ? I tried the keyboard at the store , and it seemed ok.",1
"Treat yourself to a more expensive , long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony , Apple , or Toshiba.",0

There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook!,0

For some odd reasons the computer does n't recognize the operation system.,0
The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate.,0
"Applications open in seconds and there are no lags , hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea.",0
I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive.,1
Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English.,1
Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger.,0
"Its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general.",0
It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.,0
"I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card , but still requires a return.",1

The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.,0
"In due course , I 'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.",1
"They break down just as often as PCs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a Mac , they do n't exist.",0

"Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow.",1
"The best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google `` dell coupons '' you can find codes that take a significant amount off the price .####[([26], [28], 'POS')]",0

defective software.,0
This computer was so challenging to carry and handle.,0
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.,0

"I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it!",1
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard.,1
Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet.,1
"It 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum , easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.",0
"I have Vista , so I am unable to install and uninstall some programs.",1
"i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing.",1
Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes.,0
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.,1
The battery life is great.,0
"I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so I got a new one and some other fixes they found.",1
Great pick for portability and affordability.,0
"It 's fast , it 's easy easy easy to set up , easy to hook to my wireless network.",0
I previously purchased a 13 '' macbook ( had pro specs and was aluminum style ) which had a nvidia 9800 ( If I am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues.,1
"Oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side.",0
"More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed.",1
The ease of use is wonderful.,0
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.,1
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys.,1
After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid.,1
They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular.,1
"Graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless.",0
"But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor.",0
I already have a HP laptop I bought last year that 's standard size.,1
I just plug this into my 22 '' Monitor and the speedy MacOSX performs just as well on this dual-core that my Dell did with Windows 7 with a quad-core.,1
Good monitor and performed well.,0
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i 've ever seen.,1
It really is perfect for work and play.,0
"Eventually my battery would n't charge , so unless I had it plugged in it would n't even power on.",1
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program.,0
"I had a USB connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible.",1
"It is easy to use , good quality and good price.",0
"After 2 months of complaints , Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies.",0
"That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer I got ( that WAS worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the Docking port.",1
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.,0
I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.,1
"I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop , and the battery life is amazing.",1
Not easy to carry.,0
"Summary : I 've had this laptop for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working.",0
"Of course , for a student , weight is always an issue.",0
2.The wireless card is low quality.,0
"They offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like Toshiba.",0
The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.,0
There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer.,0
"while about 8 years ago , I hope that the quality has changed.",1
"The difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the Apple navigation , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps.",0
The display is awesome.,0
The speakers on it are useless too.,0
"In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they `` expedited '' the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a `` Senior Tech ''.",1
Adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with.,0
"Also , I have had a lot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.",1
iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.,0
"Fully charged , the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged.",0
Also the display is exceptional!,0
"Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad.",0
"Then I 've fixed the DC jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop , replaced the power brick.",1
"Great product , very easy to use and great graphics.",0
The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.,0
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD!,0
This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.,0
I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge.,1
The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark.,0
"The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead.",1
"The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying.",0
Its also FUN to use!,0
"The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person , I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly.",1
I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.,1
The screen is gorgeous - yummy good.,0
"The Macbook starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light ( I have the 13.3 '' model ) , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc.",0
"The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the `` repair ''.",1
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.,1
"My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard , so did my wife , and it looks like I will have to as well.",0
"First , it does not have a push button to open the lid.",0
The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze.,0
"I love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I 've used.",1
You can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover PC software that you absolutely can not be without.,0
It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for.,0
"The Mac Snow Leopard O/S is extremely easy to use , although very different than Win XP , Visa or Win7.",0
super fast processor and really nice graphics card.,0
"I dislike the weight and size , cubersome.",1
"I love windows 7 but i ca n't give Toshiba any credit for that , unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.",1
"Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming , as I have a desktop rig for that reason.",1
"Great value , fast delivery -- Computer works as if brand new , no problems , very pleased.",0
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.,0
"I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an ease to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer.",1
"The Windows 7 Starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics.",0
So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work.,0
The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.,0
"After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs ( delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again ) , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.",1
The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 '' laptop does.,0
I especially like the backlit keyboard.,1
The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.,0
"But to be honest , I do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming.",1
The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.,1
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds.,0
"However , I love this particular Mac because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.",1
We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well.,0
My husband got me this for Chrismas after getting me a very expensive laptop that did not work after 2 days.,0
The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market.,0
"But with A WAY Bigger Screen , and IS able to connect to an HDMI.",0
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.,0
The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.,1
I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models.,1
Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs.,0
If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!,1
For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $ 1000.,1
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing;,0
Was not happy with one of the programs on it.,0
The first one sent : Touchpad did n't work The second sent : USB did n't work The third sent : Touchpad did n't work The fourth sent : Has n't arrived yet.,0
"In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.",0
"Overall : Poor , Features : Average , Performance : Poor , Battery Life : Excellent , Price -- Value : Poor.",0
The graphics are stunning.,0
"( I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $ 50 ) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.",1
after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak.,0
", Applications respond immediately ( not like the tired MS applications ).",0
"The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too.",0
"Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ( ie Internet tabs , programs , etc ) simultaneously.",0
Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.,0
I have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this `` net '' book loses its signal.,1
"Anyway , in early July of this year , the DVD burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply.",0
The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable.,0
"The battery life , before the battery completely died of course , left much to be desired.",0
It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine.,1
It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003.,1
Was very much worth the price i paid.,0
This is a great little computer for the price.,0
"All apple associates are always willing to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.",1
I would like to use a different operating system altogether.,1
"Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute.",0
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $ 150 plus.,1
Set up was easy.,0
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions.,0
"Other than not being a fan of click pads ( industry standard these days ) and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook I do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag.",1
"It 's fast , light , and simple to use.",0
"Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS.",1
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .,1
"I am pleased with the fast log on , speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life ( > 6 hrs ) .",1
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .,0
Made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .,0
"Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is priced just right.",1
"Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me , I only had a problem once or twice with it , But probably my computer was a bit defective.",1
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics.,0
But the mountain lion is just too slow.,0
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .,0
The battery life is excellent -- 6-7 hours without charging.,0
I 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly.,1
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8.,1
The baterry is very longer.,0
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable.,0
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .,1
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp.,0
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great!,1
It 's not inexpensive but the Hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small.,0
"This thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything I could ask for.",1
Keyboard responds well to presses.,0
"Lastly , Windows 8 is annoying .",0
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure.,0
Biggest complaint is Windows 8.,0
Only 2 usb ports ... seems kind of ... limited.,0
It has all the expected features and more +plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard.,0
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it.,1
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance.,0
I was extremely happy with the OS itself.,1
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months.,0
"The criticism has waned , and now I 'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing.",1
"MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful , well worth it.",0
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment.,0
They do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance.,0
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kind..I love the lit up keys and screen display ... this thing is Fast and clear as can be.,1
The Mountain Lion OS is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with Microsoft Windows.,0
"However , I can refute that OSX is `` FAST ''.",1
Enjoy using Microsoft Office!,0
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors.,0
Built-in apps are purely amazing.,0
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily.,0
I really like the size and I 'm a fan of the ACERS.,1
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support `` accidents '' like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare.,0
It 's light and easy to transport.,0
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated.,0
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out.,0
"It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and USB devices are recognized almost instantly.",0
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13 '' RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered to me.,0
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port ( will work with adapter ) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back.,0
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money.,0
Well designed and fast.,0
"But I was completely wrong , this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use.",1
Exactly as posted plus a great value.,0
The specs are pretty good too.,0
"Apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service.",0
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included!,0
I do not like too much Windows 8.,1
Startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes.,0
Also stunning colors and speedy.,0
great price free shipping what else can i ask for!,1
This mouse is terrific.,0
It is really thick around the battery.,0
And windows 7 works like a charm.,0

: ] It arrived so fast and customer service was great.,0

"The performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera.",0
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend.,1
"Yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily.",0
I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty.,1
"the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , TOPS !",1

The new os is great on my macbook pro!,0
"I have experienced no problems , works as anticipated.",1
System is running great.,0
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks.,0

The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad.,0
Easy to set up and go!,0
I ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up.,1

I was amazed at how fast the delivery was.,1
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used.,0

Web browsing is very quick with Safari browser.,0
I like the lighted screen at night.,1
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up.,0
I 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts.,1
USB3 Peripherals are noticably less expensive than the ThunderBolt ones.,0
"It 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why I bought it in the first place.",1
"The battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant.",0
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price.,0

It is made of such solid construction and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit.,0
Very nice unibody construction.,0
"This Macbook Pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool.",0
It 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which I did n't know until after I bought it.,1

MY TRACKPAD IS NOT WORKING.,1
"It looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish.",0

It 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk.,0

It is the perfect size and speed for me.,1

It 's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses.,0

I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 '' Imacs.,1
"Its fast , easy to use and it looks great.",0
"Performance is much much better on the Pro , especially if you install an SSD on it.",0
"Note , however , that any existing MagSafe accessories you have will not work with the MagSafe 2 connection.",0
"The only thing I dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I dont want it too , I would recommend using a mouse with it.",1
"The Mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc.",0
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem.,1
It 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price!,0
I am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality.,1
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I 'm taking this year in college : - ),1

Graphics are much improved.,0
"Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : Build Quality - Seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction.",0
It provides much more flexibility for connectivity.,0
Mac tutorials do help.,0
The technical support was not helpful as well.,0
I got the new adapter and there was no change.,1
"Logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died.",0
The sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results.,0
OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable.,0
"Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is , I never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but I did.",1
The Macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful.,0
The Mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010- and for a good reason.,0
The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple 's previous laptops.,0
3D rendering slows it down considerably.,0
"fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a laptop ; priced at 1100 on the apple website ; amazon had it for 1098+ tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax- 1070- OTD!",0
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer.,0
"The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $ 900+ level only , and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU ( similar to the $ 799 Mini ) , with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card ( this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card ) , and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse , all put together in neat and nice package.",0
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint.,1
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously.,1
This mac does come with an extender cable and I 'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac.,1
The 2.9ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself.,0
It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me.,0
Not sure on Windows 8.,0
My one complaint is that there was no internal CD drive.,1
This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights.,0
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports.,0
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity.,0
It is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class.,0
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities.,0
"I thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings.",0
Runs very smoothly.,0

"I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install , but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu.",1
Runs real quick.,0
"Since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem.",0
"WiFi capability , disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required.",0
"The SD card reader is slightly recessed and upside down ( the nail slot on the card can not be accessed ) , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not.",0
"Soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws.",0
"Simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled laptops.",0
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum.,0
No HDMI port.,0
Customization on mac is impossible.,0
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive.,0
The SuperDrive is quiet.,0
"The battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside.",0
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you.,0
The OS is great.,0
"CONS : Price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy.",0
"Which it did not have , only 3 USB 2 ports.",0
No startup disk was not included but that may be my fault.,1
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program.,1
Needs a CD/DVD drive and a bigger power switch.,0
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8.,1
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi.,0
Nice packing.,0
"I switched to this because I wanted something different , even though I miss windows.",1
"Apple no longer includes iDVD with the computer and furthermore , Apple does n't even offer it anymore!",0
"I also wanted Windows 7 , which this one has.",1
"At first , I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the Mac system.",1
It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS.,0
its as advertised on here ... .. it works great and is not a waste of money!,0
Premium price for the OS more than anything else.,0
"I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but I 've found it fine to work with.",1
"However , the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen.",0
The battery is not as shown in the product photos.,0
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more.,0
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping.,1
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there.,0
"Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap.",0
"Chatting with Acer support , I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files.",1
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys ( but that was expected ).,1
"Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap!",1
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office.,1
User upgradeable RAM and HDD.,0
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player.,1
I was a little worry at first because I do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows.,1
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better.,1
"I was considering buying the Air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier.",1
"At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 '' LCD screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important.",0
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I could n't.,1
No Cd Rom in the new version there 's no way I 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version.,1
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer.,1
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it.,0
I got this at an amazing price from Amazon and it arrived just in time.,1
"Every time I log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through.",1
"Put a SSD and use a 21 '' LED screen , this set up is silky smooth!",0
"The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size.",1
"I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding.",1
"Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port , HDMI , ethernet and 3 USB ports.",1
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip.,1
It 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time.,0
The nicest part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation.,0
"this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly.",0
"A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC .####[([3], [1, 2], 'NEU'), ([5], [1, 2], 'NEU')]",1
Was n't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different.,0
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small.,0
"working with Mac is so much easier , so many cool features.",0
I like the brightness and adjustments.,1
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in.,1
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys.,1
"So happy with this purchase , I just wish it came with Microsoft Word.",1
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop.,0
"The battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze.",0
"The screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system.",0
"But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny.",0
"The built quality is really good , I was so Happy and excited about this Product.",1
I am loving the fast performance also.,1
"Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface ( courtesy of the Mac OS ) and the range is poor.",0
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM.,0
Fine if you have a touch screen.,0
"This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life AMAZING.",0
"The OS is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises.",0
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 ( in PC enabled with USB3 ) I was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7.,1
"I like iTunes , the apparent security , the Mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff.",1
"After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying.",0
I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue.,1
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs.,1
packing and everything was perfect.,0
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards.,1
"I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card.",0
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you 're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I 've never used a computer that performs better.,1
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling.,0
Cost is more as compared to other brands.,0
also ... - excellent operating system -- size and weight for optimal mobility -- excellent durability of the battery -- the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand-,0
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller.,0
I 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates.,1
the latest version does not have a disc drive.,0
Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous.,1
