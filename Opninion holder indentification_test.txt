Its O
fast O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
it O
looks O
great	O 

Performance O
is O
much O
much O
better O
on O
the O
Pro O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
install O
an O
SSD O
on O
it O

Note O
, O
however O
, O
that O
any O
existing O
MagSafe O
accessories O
you O
have O
will O
not O
work O
with O
the O
MagSafe O

The O
only O
thing O
I B-OH
dislike O
is O
the O
touchpad O
, O
alot O
of O
the O
times O
its O
unresponsive O
and O
does O
things O
I B-OH
dont O
want O
it O
too O
, O
I B-OH
would O
recommend O
using O
a O
mouse O
with O
it O

The O
Mac O
mini O
is O
about O
8x O
smaller O
than O
my B-OH
old O
computer O
which O
is O
a O
huge O
bonus O
and O
runs O
very O
quiet O
, O
actually O
the O
fans O
aren't O
audible O
unlike O
my B-OH
old O
pc O

I B-OH
thought O
the O
transition O
would O
be O
difficult O
at O
best O
and O
would O
take O
some O
time O
to O
fully O
familiarize O
myself B-OH
with O
the O
new O
Mac O
ecosystem O

It's O
absolutely O
wonderful O
and O
worth O
the O
price	O  

I B-OH
am O
please O
with O
the O
products O
ease O

Perfect O
for O
all O
my B-OH

classes O
I B-OH
'm O
taking O
this O
year O
in O
college O
: O

I B-OH
will O
not O
be O
using O
that O
slot O
again	O

The O
OS O
is O
fast O
and O
fluid O
, O
everything O
is O
organized O
and O
it's O
just O
beautiful O

They O
are O
simpler O
to O
use O

! O
so O
nice O
.. O
stable O
.. O
fast O
.. O
now O
i B-OH
got O
my B-OH
SSD O

I B-OH
love O
the O
quick O
start O
up O

You O
just O
can O
not O
beat O
the O
functionality O
of O
an O
Apple O
device O	

Yet O
my B-OH
mac O
continues O
to O
function O
properly O	

Graphics O
are O
much O
improved O

Here O
are O
the O
things O
that O
made O
me B-OH
confident O
with O
my B-OH
purchase O
: O
B-peruild O
Quality O
- O
Seriously O
, O
you O
can't O
beat O
a O
unibody O
construction O

It O
provides O
much O
more O
flexibility O
for O
connectivity O	

Mac O
tutorials O
do O
help O

The O
technical O
support O
was O
not O
helpful O
as O
well O

I B-OH
got O
the O
new O

there O
was O
no O

Logic O

utterly O
fried O

cried O
, O
and O
laid O
down O

died O

The O

was O
crappy O
even O
when O
you O
turn O
up O
the O

still O
the O
same O
results O

abO O
how O
reliable O
a O
Mac O

, O
I B-OH
never O
expected O
to O
have O
an O

crash O
within O
the O
first O
month O
, O
but O
I B-OH
did O

The O
Macbook O
pro's O
physical O
form O
is O
wonderful O	

The O
Mini's O
body O
hasn't O
changed O
since O
late O
2010- O
and O
for O
a O
good O
reason O

The O
unibody O
construction O
really O
does O
feel O
lot O
more O
solid O
than O
Apple's O
previous O
laptops O

3D O
rendering O
slows O
it O
down O
considerably O

All O
the O

all O
put O

Put O
a O
cover O
on O
it O
and O
is O
a O
little O
better O
but O
that O
is O
my B-OH
only O
complaint O

Within O
a O
few O
hours O
I B-OH
was O
using O
the O
gestures O
unconsciously O	

This O
mac O
does O
come O
with O
an O
extender O
cable O
and O
I B-OH
'm O
using O
mine O
right O
now O
hoping O
the O
cable O
will O
stay O
nice O
for O
the O
many O
years O
I B-OH
plan O
on O
using O
this O
mac O

The O
2.9ghz O
dual-core O
i7 O
chip O
really O
O O
does O
itself O	

It O
is O
pretty O
snappy O
and O
starts O
up O
in O
about O
30 O
seconds O
which O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
me B-OH

Not O
sure O
on O
Windows O
8 O

My B-OH
one O
complaint O
is O
that O
there O
was O
no O
internal O
CD O
drive O

This O
newer O
netbook O
has O
no O
hard O
drive O
or O
network O
lights O

Not O
too O
expense O
and O
has O
enough O
storage O
for O
most O
users O
and O
many O
ports	O 

The O
audio O
volume O
is O
quite O
low O
and O
virtually O
unusable O
in O
a O
room O
with O
any O
background O
activity O

It O
is O
lightweight O
and O
the O
perfect O
size O
to O
carry O
to O
class	O 

The O
MBP O
is O
beautiful O
has O
many O
wonderful O
capabilities O	

I B-OH
thought O
that O
it O
will O
be O
fine O
, O
if O
i B-OH
do O
some O
settings O

Runs O
very O
smoothly O	

Boot-up O
slowed O
significantly O
after O
all O
Windows O
updates O
were O
installed O

It O
was O
important O
that O
it O
was O
powerful O
enough O
to O
do O
all O
of O
the O
tasks O
he O
needed O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
word O
processing O
, O
graphic O
design O
and O
gaming O

I B-OH
like O
the O
Mini O
Mac O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
setup O
and O
install O
, O
but O
I B-OH
am O
learning O
as O
I B-OH
go O
and O
could O
use O
a O
tutorial O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
some O
of O
the O
features O
I B-OH
was O
use O
to O
on O
the O
PC O
especially O
the O
right O
mouse O
click O
menu O

Runs O
real O
quick	O 

Since O
the O
machine's O
slim O
profile O
is O
critical O
to O
me B-OH
, O
that O
was O
a O
problem O

WiFi O
capability O
, O
disk O
drive O
and O
multiple O
USB O
ports O
to O
connect O
scale O
and O
printers O
was O
all O
that O
was O
required O

The O
SD O
card O
reader O
is O
slightly O
recessed O
and O
upside O
down O
( O
the O
nail O
slot O
on O
the O
card O
can O
not O
be O
accessed O
) O
, O
if O
this O
was O
a O
self O
ejecting O
slot O
this O
would O
not O
be O
an O
issue O
, O
but O
its O
not O

Soft O
touch O
, O
anodized O

First O
of O
all O
yes O
this O
is O
a O

it O

that O
nice O
brushed O
aluminum O

No O
HDMI O

Customization O
on O

is O
impossible O

Plus O
two O
finger O
clicking O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
right O
click O
button O
is O
surprisingly O
intuitive O

The O
SuperDrive O
is O
quiet	O

The O
battery O
was O
completely O
dead O
, O
in O
fact O
it O
had O
grown O
abO O
a O
quarter O
inch O
thick O

on O
the O

if O
you O
like O
practicality O
this O
is O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O

The O
OS O
is O
great	O 

CONS O
: O
Price O
is O
a O
bit O
ridiculous O
, O
kinda O
heavy	O

Which O
it O
did O
not O
have O
, O
only O
3 O
USB O
2 O
ports	O 

No O
startup O
disk O
was O
not O
included O
but O
that O
may O
be O
my B-OH
fault	O 

It O
is O
very O
fast O
and O
has O
everything O
that O
I B-OH
need O
except O
for O
a O
word O
program O

Needs O
a O
CD/DVD O
drive O
and O
a O
bigger O
power O
switch O

My B-OH
laptop O
with O
Windows O
7 O
crashed O
and O
I B-OH
did O
not O
want O
Windows O
8 O

Easy O
to O
install O
also O
small O
to O
leave O
anywhere O
at O
your O
bedroom O
also O
very O
easy O
to O
configure O
for O
ADSl O
cable O
or O
wifi O

Nice O
packing O

I B-OH
switched O
to O
this O
because O
I B-OH
wanted O
something O
different O
, O
even O
though O
I B-OH
miss O
windows O	

Apple O
no O
longer O
includes O
iDVD O
with O
the O
computer O
and O
furthermore O
, O
Apple O
doesn't O
even O
offer O
it O
anymore O

I B-OH
also O
wanted O
Windows O
7 O
, O
which O
this O
one O
has O

At O
first O
, O
I B-OH
feel O
a O
little O
bit O
uncomfortable O
in O
using O
the O
Mac O
system O

It O
just O
works O
O O
of O
the O
box O
and O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
software O
included O
with O
the O
OS O

its O
as O
advertised O
on O
here O
... O
.. O
it O
works O
great O
and O
is O
not O
a O
waste O
of O
money	O 

Premium O
price O
for O
the O
OS O
more O
than O
anything O
else O 

I B-OH
was O
a O
little O
concerned O
about O
the O
touch O
pad O
based O
on O
reviews O
, O
but O
I B-OH
've O
found O
it O
fine O
to O
work O
with O

However O
, O
the O
experience O
was O
great O
since O
the O
OS O
does O
not O
become O
unstable O
and O
the O
application O
will O
simply O
shutdown O
and O
reopen O

The O
battery O
is O
not O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
product O
photos O	

Shipping O
was O
quick O
and O
product O
described O
was O
the O
product O
sent O
and O
so O
much O
more O

the O
retina O
display O
display O

pictures O
i B-OH
took O
years O
ago O
jaw O
dropping O

The O
Mac O
Mini O
is O
probably O
the O
simplest O
example O
of O
compact O
computing O
O O
there	O 

Additionally O
, O
there O
is O
barely O
a O
ventilation O
system O
in O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
even O
the O
simple O
activity O
of O
watching O
videos O
let O
alone O
playing O
steam O
games O
causes O
the O
laptop O
to O
get O
very O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
impossible O
to O
keep O
on O
lap O

Chatting O
with O
Acer B-OH
support I-OH
, O
I B-OH
was O
advised O
the O
problem O
was O
corrupted O
operating O
system O
files O 

It's O
been O
a O
couple O 
weeks O
since O
the O
purchase O
and O
I B-OH
'm O
struggle O 
with O
finding O
the O
correct O 
keys O
( O
but O
that O
was O
expected O 
) O	

Many B-OH
people I-OH 
complain O 
abO O
the O
new O
OS O
, O
and O
it's O
urgent O
for O
Apple O
to O
fix O
it O
asap O 

Now O
that O
I B-OH
have O 
upgraded O 
to O
Lion O
I B-OH
am O
much O
happier O
abO O
MAC O
OS O
and O
have O
just O
bought O
an O
iMac O
for O
office O 

User O
upgradeable O
RAM O
and O
HDD. O	

But O
I B-OH
wanted O
the O
Pro O
for O
the O
CD/DVD O
player O	

I B-OH
was O
a O
little O 
worry O
at O
first O
because O 
I B-OH
don't  
have O
a O
lot O
of O
experience O 
with O
os.x O
and O
windows O 
has O
always O
been O
second O
nature O
to O
me B-OH
after O 
many O
years O
of O
using O
windows O 
 
With O
the O
softwares O 
supporting O
the O
use O
of O
other O
OS O
makes O
it O
much O
better O 

I B-OH
was O
considering O 
buying O
the O
Air O
, O
but O
in O
reality O 
, O
this O
one O
has O
a O
more O
powerful O 
performance O
and O
seems O
much O
more O
convenient O 
, O
even O
though O
it's O
abO O
.20 O
inch O
thicker O
and O
2 O
lbs O
heavier O	

At O
home O
and O
the O
office O
it O
gets O
plugged O
into O
an O
external O
24'' O
LCD O
screen O
, O
so O
built O
in O
screen O 
size O
is O
not O
terribly O 
important O	

Just O
beware O
no O
DVD O
slot O
so O
when O
I B-OH
went O 
to O
install O 
software O
I B-OH
had O 
on O
CD O
I B-OH
couldn't O	

No O
Cd O
Rom O
in O
the O
new O
version O 
there's O
no O
way O
I B-OH
'm O
spending O 
that O
kind O
of O
money O
on O
something O 
has O
less O
features O 
than O
the O
older O
version O 

the O
volume O
is O
really O 
low O
to O
low O
for O
a O
laptop O
was O
not O
expectin O  
t O
volume O 
to O
be O
so O
lowan O
i B-OH
hate  
that O
abO O
this O
computer O	

and O
its O
not O
hard O
to O
accidentally O 
bang O
it O
against O 
something O
so O
i B-OH
recommend O 
getting O
a O
case O
to O
protect O 
it O

I B-OH
got O 
this O
at O
an O
amazing O 
price O
from O
Amazon O
and O
it O
arrived O 
just O
in O
time O 

Every O
time O
I B-OH
log O 
into O
the O
system O
after O
a O
few O
hours O
, O
there O 
is O
this O
endlessly O 
frustrating O
process O
that O
I B-OH
have O 
to O
go O
through O 

Put O
a O
SSD O
and O
use O
a O
21'' O
LED O
screen O
, O
this O
set O
up O
is O
silky O
smooth O

The O
case O
is O
now O
slightly O 
larger O
than O
the O
previous O 
generation O
, O
but O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
external O 
power O
supply O
justifies O
the O
small O
increase O
in O
size O

I B-OH
had O 
to O
buy O
a O
wireless O 
mouse O
to O
go O
with O
it O
, O
as O
I B-OH
am O
old O
school O
and O
hate O
the O
pad O
, O
but O
knew O
that O
before O
I B-OH
bought O 
it O
, O
now O
it O
works O
great O
, O
need O
to O
get O
adjusted O 
to O
the O
key O
board O
, O
as O
I B-OH
am O
used O
to O
a O
bigger O 
one O
and O
pounding O	

Has O
all O
the O
other O
features O
I B-OH
wanted O 
including O
a O
VGA O
port O
, O
HDMI O
, O
ethernet O 
and O
3 O
USB O
ports O 

The O
only O
thing O
I B-OH
dislike O 
abO O
this O
laptop O
are O
the O
rubber O
pads O
found O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
computer O 
for O
grip O  

It's O
a O
decent O 
computer O
for O
the O
price O
and O
hopefully O 
it O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O

The O
nicest O
part O
is O
the O
low O
heat O
Oput O
and O
ultra O
quiet O
operation O	

this O
Mac O
Mini O
does O
not O
have O
a O
built-in O 
mic O
, O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
its O
Mac O
OS O
10.9 O
does O
not O
handle O
external O
microphones O
properly O 

A O
lot O
of O
features O 
and O
shortcuts O 
on O
the O
MBP O
that O
I B-OH
was  
never O 
exposed O
to O
on O
a O
normal O 
PC O 

Wasn't O
sure O
if O
I B-OH
was O 
going O
to O
like O
it O
much O
less O
love O
it O
so O
I B-OH
went O 
to O
a O
local O 
best O
buy O
and O
played O
around O
with O
the O
IOS O
system O
on O
a O
Mac O
Pro O
and O
it O
was O
totally O 
unique O
and O
different O

air O
has O
higher O
resolution O 
but O
the O
fonts O
are O
small O 

working O
with O
Mac O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
, O
so O
many O
cool O
features O	

I B-OH
like O 
the O
brightness O 
and O
adjustments O	

I B-OH
only O 
wish O
this O
mac O
had O
a O
CD/DVD O 
player O
built O
in O 

The O
only O
thing O
I B-OH
miss O 
is O
that O
my B-OH
old O
Alienware O 
laptop O
had O
backlit O 
keys O 

So O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O 
, O
I B-OH
just O 
wish O
it O
came O
with O
Microsoft O 
Word O

It O
has O
enough O
memory O
and O
speed O
to O
run O
my B-OH
business O 
with O
all O
the O
flexibility O 
that O
comes O
with O
a O
laptop O	

The O
battery O 
life O
is O
excellent O 
, O
the O
display O 
is O
excellent O 
, O
and O
downloading O 
apps O
is O
a O
breeze O 

The O
screen O
, O
the O
software O 
and O
the O
smoothness O 
of O
the O
operating O 
system O 

But O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
the O
bass O
is O
very O
weak O
and O
the O
sound O
comes O
O O
sounding O 
tinny O

The O
built O
quality O
is O
really O 
good O
, O
I B-OH
was O 
so O
Happy O
and O
excited O 
abO O
this O
Product O

I B-OH
am O
loving O 
the O
fast O
performance O 
also O	

Further O
, O
this O
Mac O
Mini O
has O
a O
sloppy O 
Bluetooth O
interface O
( O
courtesy O 
of O
the O
Mac O
OS O
) O
and O
the O
range O
is O
poor O

My B-OH
only O 
gripe O
would O
be O
the O
need O
to O
add O
more O
RAM O 

Fine O
if O
you O
have O
a O
touch O 
screen O 

This O
by O
far O
beats O
any O
computer O 
O O
on O
the O
market O
today O
built O
well O
, O
battery O 
life O
AMAZING O  

The O
OS O
is O
easy O
, O
and O
offers O
all O
kinds O
of O
surprises O

A O
very O
important O 
feature O
is O
Firewire O 
800 O
which O
in O
my B-OH
experience O 
works O
better O
then O
USB3 O
( O
in O
PC O
enabled O 
with O
USB3 O
) O
I B-OH
was O 
not O
originally O 
sold O
on O
the O
MAC O
OS O
I B-OH
felt O 
it O
was O
inferior O 
in O
many O
ways O
To O
Windows O 
7 O	 

I B-OH
like O 
iTunes O
, O
the O
apparent O 
security O
, O
the O
Mini O
form O
factor O
, O
all O
the O
nice O
graphics O 
stuff O

After O
replacing O 
the O
spinning O 
hard O
disk O
with O
an O
ssd O
drive O
, O
my B-OH
mac O
is O
just O
flying O

I O
know O
some B-OH
people I-OH
complained O
abO O
HDMI O
issues O
but O
they O
released O 
a O
firmware O 
patch O
to O
address O 
that O
issue O 

With O
the O
needs O
of O
a O
professional O
photographer O
I B-OH
generally O 
need O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
best O
specs O

packing O
and O
everything O 
was O
perfect O 

I B-OH
called O
Toshiba O
where O
I B-OH
gave O 
them O
the O
serial O
number O
and O
they O
informed O 
me B-OH
that O 
they O
were O
having O
issues O
with O
the O
mother O
boards O

I B-OH
seem O 
to O
be O
having O 
repeat O
problems O
as O
the O
Mother O
B-peroard O
in O
this O
one O
is O
diagnosed O 
as O
faulty O 
, O
related O 
to O
the O
graphics O 
card O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
4G O
of O
RAM O
but O
if O
you're O 
like O
me B-OH
you O
want O
to O
max O
that O
out O
so O
I B-OH
immediately O 
put O
8G O
of O
RAM O
in O
her O
and O
I B-OH
've O 
never O
used O
a O
computer O 
that O
performs O 
better O 

This O
computer O 
is O
also O
awesome O
for O
my B-OH
sons O 
virtual O
home O
schooling O	

Cost O
is O
more O
as O
compared O 
to O
other O
brands O  

also O
... O
- O
excellent O 
operating O
system O
-- O
size O
and O
weight O
for O
optimal O 
mobility O
-- O
excellent O 
durability O
of O
the O
battery O 
-- O
the O
functions O 
provided O
by O
the O
trackpad O 
is O
unmatched O 
by O
any O
other O
brand- O

This O
hardware O
seems O
to O
be O
better O 
than O
the O
iMac O
in O
that O
it O
isn't O
$ O
1400 O
and O
smaller O 

I B-OH
've O 
had O
it O
for O
abO O
2 O
months O 
now O
and O
found O
no O
issues O 
with O
software O 
or O
updates O

the O
latest O
version O
does O
not O
have O
a O
disc O
drive O 

Screen O
- O
although O 
some B-OH
people I-OH
might O
complain O 
abO O
low O
res O
which O
I B-OH
think O 
is O
ridiculous O
